      <DefaultText>As you crest a small hill overlooking Yenwood Field, Lord Gathbin's army is a flurry of activity, scurrying to and fro. Even from this distance, you can hear the drums of war beating their steady cadence designed to intimidate their foes while organizing the rank and file into battle formations.

Marshal Forywn approaches. "You've arrived just in time. Lord Gathbin's forces are beginning to move - an attack is imminent."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Local militia constitutes the majority of the army, but veteran soldiers have organized the ranks and walk amongst the young, unseasoned warriors offering advice or the occasional joke.

      <DefaultText>Then, a group of Aedyran Battlemages emerges from behind the enemy lines. They begin weaving their hands in unison with practiced precision. Suddenly, waves of arcane fire erupt among your troops. The acrid smell of smoke and burning flesh is nearly overwhelming.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The crag ogres fearlessly charge the berserker enemies. The fighting is brutal as both Rauatai and ogre warriors refuse to give ground. But the size and strength of the ogre shock troops proves too much for the smaller Rauatai. When the smoke clears, not a single berserker is left standing.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The Knights of the Crucible form a shieldwall to reinforce the crumbling left flank. Rauatai berserkers throw themselves against the wall with reckless abandon. Each time a knight falls, another steps into the breach, shield held high and spear at the ready. The berserkers losses are many, and within a few minutes, it is clear the wall will hold.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The arquebusiers quickly form a line and unleash a salvo of gunfire on the charging berserkers. Bullets tear through their plate armor and the berserkers fall by the score. By the time the berserkers realize the danger and attempt to charge the gunmen, another volley rips most of them to pieces. Those left standing quickly retreat. While the line has held, you spot dozens of your own troops killed by the gunfire.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The knights lock shields and drive forward in a wedge formation through the enemy lines. The formation allows them to penetrate the line quickly but leads to heavy losses. As they reach the battlemages the formation falls apart. The battlemages cease their magical attack against your lines, as the remaining knights put them to the sword, but you fear the maneuver has sealed a grisly fate for the last of the knights.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The crag ogres charge the Gathbin lines in a blood frenzy. Using their size, many of the ogres leap over the enemy line, ignoring grievous wounds. While many fall, nearly a dozen reach the battlemages. 

A high-pitched scream permeates the din of battle as you see an unarmed ogre lift one of the mages overhead and rip him in two. Shortly after, the magical barrage against your army ceases.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Accurate arrow fire from the Readcerans disrupts and fells many of the battlemages, but arcane defenses thwart some of the arrows.

The survivors retreat from the battle and move out of range, but not before hurling a volley of fireballs into your archers' ranks. The screams of the dying echo in your ears as the Readcerans are set afire.</DefaultText>

With Gathbin's elite guard behind them and the line in front of them, the Bleak Walkers are forced to charge. 

This doesn't stop the Pathfinders from launching volley after volley into both the knights, and their allied troops on the front line. Each volley lands with devastating effect as dozens of enemies drop to the bloody earth clutching lethal arrow wounds. </DefaultText>
