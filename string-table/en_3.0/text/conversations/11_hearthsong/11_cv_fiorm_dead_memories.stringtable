      <DefaultText>Beneath the raging waterfall, the corpse of an elven Glanfathan hunter lies shattered against the rocks. Broken bones protrude through its skin, but you also notice deep, parallel cuts in the rotting flesh.

The slashes trace almost every part of the body, as if it had been ravaged by a dozen blades. This man probably died before his fall from the cliffs above.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You touch the dead elf's forehead, droplets of water glistening down its purple surface, and feel a sudden jolt from the hunter's lingering essence. The world around you fades away...</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>...You're walking among the underbrush without making a sound. Moonlight catches sight of your arms, shining them pale, but you quickly dart again into the shadows of the giant trees of the Northweald. Your Blood Brother is not so deft, as you expected...

...Look at him. Frail. Unaware. He doesn't deserve to share the glory of this hunt. It's been countless seasons since a stelgaer like this one, twice the size of its lesser kin, has roamed the forests near Twin Elms...</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>...Arthwn fell for the trick. You almost feel pity for him, but you've convinced yourself that he'd only get in the way once the killing begins. He'll be safer by the river, expecting that we'll flank the stelgaer when it comes out to drink. But this kill will be only yours...

...The stelgaer is larger than you imagined. It stands without fear atop the waterfall's ridge, its silhouette cutting a monstrous hole against the mantle of the night sky. A beast of legend. A true hunter...</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>...Your hand tightens around the shaft of your father's spear. The weight feels balanced, just right, as you prepare the throw. You put everything into it. The spear flies true and hits its mark. The stelgaer didn't even hear a sound. Its blood spills bright on the rocks... yet it stands unfazed.

...The beast pounces. Moonlight shines over its great fangs. Your hands draw your blades, without a second thought, as you lunge forward to meet this monster... It's fast. It's ripping your flesh apart. You stab at the darkness engulfing you, deep, again, and again. But there is no slowing its embrace.</DefaultText>
