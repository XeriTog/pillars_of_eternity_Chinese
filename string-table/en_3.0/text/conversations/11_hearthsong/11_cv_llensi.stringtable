      <DefaultText>"The locals have called me a wise woman - a term of respect, I'm sure, but it makes me feel my years. I'm an herbalist and healer. I spend most of my time caring for the ill, helping with the delivery of children, and making remedies for those in pain."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Stop right there!" Llensi yells as your hand nears the bird cage. "Just what do you think you're doing with my bird?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Delem, chanter of oldsong, sent me get a specimen of this type of bird."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She stares at you blankly for a moment before shaking her head. "That fop Delem sent you? No - absolutely not. Eating my beloved pet won't grant that fool musical prowess. The only thing he'll get is an upset stomach and the pain of passing a beak."

She folds her arms and frowns. "There's a forest full of birds - mine's not for sale."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I agree, killing your bird seems unnecessary - I will look elsewhere."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Why would Delem believe that eating birds will help?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Animals aren't ours to cage. I don't think you or Delem should have it - the bird should be free."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Old folklore gone awry," she mutters, shrugging in resignation.

"Orlans, particularly those raised in the forest, still seem to believe that, by eating noteworthy creatures, they can gain the desirable traits of their prey."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Such a fragile little thing... perhaps I should tear it down the middle and give half to Delem and half to you."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Well..." she stares at you blankly. "It's not like the bird is a prisoner. I mean... he has a little bit of room to fly in there..."

"You just want me to set Beaker free so you can snatch him and sell him to Delem."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"You wouldn't!" her hands cover her mouth to hide a fearful whimper.

She looks you up and down, her eyes wide with alarm. "Why would you want to kill poor little Beaker? What did he do to you?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Her face turns flush as she smiles. "I'm relieved you see it my way. How would you like it if someone demanded your cherished pet as a snack?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"It's false - eating a spider doesn't give you eight legs any more than eating ivy lets you sprout berries."

Llensi sighs with resignation. "If Delem wants to be a better singer, he should try practice, not superstition."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"This will keep me up all night. Just take him - bring him into the forest and set him free."

She bites her lip and waves her hands at you. "Now begone!"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Delem isn't getting the bird. I'll release it somewhere safe - you won't have to worry about Mr. Beaker being unhappy."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Her face blanches with surprise. "You can't talk to me like that! Get out! Get out of my house right now!"</DefaultText>

      <ID>28</ID>
      <DefaultText>Her face trembles as her eyes well up. "Look, I don't want any trouble. Take the bird and begone! May your soul rot and leave you hollow!"</DefaultText>

      <ID>30</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Well he does," she blushes, "but I ought not to have let my friend's daughter name him... The name is long and rather silly. The short version is 'Beaker.'"

She rolls her eyes and smiles. "The next bird I have will be named after an anamfath."</DefaultText>
