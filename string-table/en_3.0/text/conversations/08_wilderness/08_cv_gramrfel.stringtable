      <DefaultText>A motley gathering stands at the crossroads. At first glance the person at the head of the group seems more monster than man. Two large and curling horns emerge from the sides of his skull, forming a hardened carapace that is pocked like coral.
 
Down its center this strange shell splits, revealing the ash-gray skin of a man's face, obscured above the nose. The horns might seem a mere helmet, save that in several places you cannot tell where the flesh ends and the bone begins. 

From the neck down, however, this is by all appearances a human man, clad in fine armor of the same dark shade as his features.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>There is a more familiar face just nearby. Wirtan stands beside the godlike. He looks up with a mixture of embarrassment and anger, seeing that you recognize him. "It figures I'd run into you out here! Haven't you done enough?" </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"To see what Waidwen has wrought." He snorts. "Or find the name of the true architect. Thousands of souls, flung out into the world... but only in the Dyrwood. In Aedyr, mothers and fathers coo undeterred over their sprats... and just across the sea, they weep."

      <DefaultText>"Myself, I am twice-blessed. Imagine, that I should walk a crossroad in some backwater and find kin upon the road." The man chuckles. "A countenance as grim as mine... We have both suffered Berath's touch, hm? And show it in our visage most clearly." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Gramrfel laughs. "I think not. I have spent some time among the lore chanters... Keep your songs, aumaua. My paeans are to Berath alone, and they speak of death... you've too much life in you by far."</DefaultText>
