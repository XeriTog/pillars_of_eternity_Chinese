      <DefaultText>A woman bends over a roaring fireplace, feeding a splintered chair leg into it. As you get closer, you notice something unnatural about her - a certain pallor to her skin, a lack of movement beneath her flesh even while her arms execute deft, efficient movements.

And then you see the puckered flesh, ragged and bloodless, over her heart.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She laughs, a noise that blends the crunch of dry leaves with something piercing and white-hot. 

"That fool, Aldhelm. He sent you, didn't he? I can hardly believe he's had the cleverness to survive. That simpleton thinks he can understand how to use something without understanding what it is. Or why it is."

      <ID>77</ID>
      <DefaultText>Icantha closes her eyes. "Teir Nowneth." Her voice is suddenly soothing. "It is called Teir Nowneth."

She stands and turns to you, wiping parchment-dry hands on her clothes. "They built the machine atop it to contain souls. Hold them in place. But the others I've seen, machines scattered all over the Dyrwood, are relays. Built to move souls."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I could help you. But I won't." The pride lodged in her soul flares up, twisting into the shape of something that writhes and squeals within her.

      <DefaultText>The fampyr doesn't seem to notice as you wrap your mind around the squalling, burning mass. 

However, it sears your very bones. You jump back, crying out in pain.

"I won't abandon this opportunity. These souls will remain here, with me, and I'll accomplish more than any animancer in the history of the field."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The pride hisses and sputters. It's little more than an ember now.

      <DefaultText>You reach for it, but it's still too hot to grasp in your mind for more than a second.

      <ID>116</ID>
      <DefaultText>"These are the words you need." Her cold, dry fingertips rest on your temples, and you feel her reaching into your mind, forming images from the darkness. Runes flash through your head, but they're no longer just pictures. They have meaning, and you understand them. They're commands.

Something triggers in your mind, a distant memory unearthed from a past life long since buried. You can see a vast array of runes, far more than Icantha has shown you, and you know their sound and their meaning and how they fit together, the language of Engwith once more at your command.</DefaultText>

      <ID>118</ID>
      <DefaultText>"They're inconsequential. Their existence means nothing. They don't even understand their predicament, which you and I see so clearly."

    <Entry>
      <ID>121</ID>
      <DefaultText>She gives you a hollow laugh. "A survivor by the grace of my own careful preparations."

She traces a finger over the jagged hole in her chest. "When I heard the claws scrabbling at the door outside, I took care of matters myself. And since then, I've been careful to keep myself fresh and fed."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"An incredible act of animancy. Of a magnitude this part of the world likely hasn't seen since Engwithan times." Her dead eyes glaze over with wonder.
