      <DefaultText>This hazy figure is tall and broad in frame, and its shifting, indistinct face is turned toward the floor, as if it were deep in thought. You hear a faint murmuring, in the repetitive cadence of prayer. From time to time the spirit seems to sway in place. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The spirit turns its face towards you in a swift motion. For a moment its features blur, and then resolve into what appears to be a man's visage, its eyes fixed upon you. He says nothing - only watches you, unmoving.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>As you approach, the spirit raises his voice, and you recognize the familiar sounds of the Engwithan tongue. 

"-and no more shall souls splinter upon the Wheel. Hear me, great Father. I am pledged against your foes, and the greatest of these is death."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The spirit turns its face towards you in a swift motion. For a moment its features blur, and then resolve into what appears to be a man's visage, its eyes fixed upon you.

      <DefaultText>The spirit watches you a moment longer, then makes a sideways movement of the head. "No. That is our oath. Our challenge." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"...My promise. Nothing shall harm us, Daga. We are nearly to the end - the statue is complete, and the well of souls lies just beneath. Our brothers and sisters will come for us, after all this is done. We will walk in this world again. But first we must save it." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The spirit turns his face away.

"They will be here soon. To cast us down. To unmake our work. It is nearly too late."</DefaultText>

      <ID>21</ID>
      <DefaultText>He shifts, standing straighter. "Are you ready?" He raises his hand, and you think you see the glint of metal, though a second glance reveals nothing. "They have placed your crest upon the animat. Alongside my own." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"They have gone ahead. But they will stand beside us, in the battles to come. In those glorious constructs. The Children of the Wheel will keep our great king safe - and be rewarded for it." </DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>30</ID>
      <DefaultText>He nods. "If they knew, perhaps they would understand. If they heard the sisters speak. ...In foreign lands they leave their madmen to suffer alone, or else cast these same out from their sight." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Meanwhile we have carved ourselves like smoothed stones, polished the virtues within us while flensing away the weakness. Is that not just? Is that not kinder than anything that came before?" </DefaultText>
