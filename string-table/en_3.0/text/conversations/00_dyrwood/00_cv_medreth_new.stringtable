      <DefaultText>An elf idles by the road, watching the village across the river. He nods as you approach, and the cowled figures standing near him fall silent.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Greetings, friend." A slow smile forms as he eyes you. "I've heard of you. Word has it you've been busy in Defiance Bay."

He draws closer. "I'm busy, too. And eager to finish my business and get back to the city."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Haven't you heard? There's a murderer on the loose. Said to have gone mad with grief and strangled a dozen healthy children when her own was Hollowborn." He nods at the figures with him. "We've come all the way from Defiance Bay to bring her to justice."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>12</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I'm here on a little errand. There's a thief hiding out in the village. An orlan named Nyfre. She took something that belongs to the Doemenels. I want to find her and get it back."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>16</ID>
      <DefaultText>A grin suddenly breaks his sober expression. "Then I suppose it's a good thing we're on this side of the river."

The gravity returns to his voice. "Seriously, now. I'm looking for someone."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>17</ID>
      <DefaultText>He nods across the river. "She's hiding out in the village. We'd go in after her ourselves, but the problem is, she knows our faces. There's no telling what she'd do if she saw us coming. And we'd like to avoid any further... unnecessary bloodshed."

He leans closer. "Her name's Nyfre. She's an orlan. We want to get her out of town so that we can deal with her cleanly. She knows we're looking for her. But if someone were to convince her that it's safe to leave..."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>21</ID>
      <DefaultText>He lays a strong hand on your shoulder. "A madwoman like that is everybody's problem, friend. Just keep an eye out. If you come across her, remember what I told you. I promise I'll make it worth your while."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>

    <Entry>
      <ID>26</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Excellent! Then go back to her and tell her you didn't see anyone looking for her. Got it?"</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>27</ID>
      <DefaultText>"She told me she was on the run, but the rest of her story was different from yours."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>28</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Of course it was!" He looks at the cowled figures standing nearby. "She's not going to tell you she's a child-killer, is she? Just..." He makes a broad, waving motion toward town. "...Go back and find her and get her to come out."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>29</ID>
      <DefaultText>He winks. "Discreet. I can see why our mutual friends trust you."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Does it matter? It belongs to the Doemenels, and they want it back."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>38</ID>
      <DefaultText>He scratches his chin, a half-smile on his face. "The Doemenels believe in setting an example. They want to make sure nonsense like this doesn't happen again."

He claps you on the back. "But leave that part to me."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>39</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Simple. All you need to do is find her and lure her out of hiding. My friends and I will take care of the rest."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>40</ID>
      <DefaultText>He frowns, fidgeting with the handle of his weapon. "The Doemenels make excellent friends and terrible enemies, as our lass Nyfre will soon find out. 

"I won't repeat what you just said. Mind that you don't, either."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>43</ID>

      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>45</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Sounds like we're both too busy to stand around chatting, then."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>46</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Strong and silent, eh? Just the kind of person I need to find her."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Is this about that Harond girl?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"No, I'm after the fugitive..." He watches your expression.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>50</ID>
      <DefaultText>He laughs. "Right to the point. Just the kind of person I need to find her."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>51</ID>
      <DefaultText>He gives you a quick, casual salute. "Help me out and I'll make sure our mutual friends hear about it."</DefaultText>

      <ID>53</ID>
      <DefaultText>A look of distaste flickers across his face. It's quick, but you catch it. "The powers that be want to keep things quiet. For obvious reasons. Better not to cause a fuss and certainly better not to startle her into doing something drastic."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>A familiar elf saunters over, picking his nails with a stiletto. You recognize him from Dyrford.

"You said to go north, and north I went. Straight into a Glanfathan hunting party before I realized you'd given me the runaround."

He points the blade at you. "And I've been slogging around this middle-of-nowhere backwater all because of you. I'll find Nyfre, all right. But first, I'm taking care of you."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Medreth claps slowly as you approach. "Well done, indeed. You've got a real knack for subtlety. It's a skill my employers truly appreciate." He hands you a pouch of coin. 

"In fact, I'm sure the Doemenels would be happy to see you the next time you're in Defiance Bay. As for me, I'm ready to leave this mudhole and get back to the city."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"She... oh." He blinks. "In that case, you have the continued gratitude of House Doemenel..." He fishes a coin pouch out of his cloak. "As well as their continued support. And you have my thanks for getting me out of this mudhole even sooner. Farewell."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"You... oh." He blinks. "That means I don't have to stick around this mudhole any longer." He fishes a coin pouch out of his cloak. "You have my thanks. House Doemenel will be grateful, too." He winks. "Farewell."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He shrugs. "I may have stretched the truth a little. But she was definitely a double-crossing thief, so you've still done the Dyrwood a service.
