      <DefaultText>A taciturn man with graying hair pores over a tome he's just withdrawn from one of the shelves. He glances up at you with baggy eyes.

"Yes? Is there something I can pull for you?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>This man busies his slender hands filing scored books and rolls of dusty parchment according to some obscure, yet deliberate scheme.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The man continues his work without looking up. "Hmm?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I'm looking for militia records from the time of the Saint's War. Trying to find out what happened to someone."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Edér frowns at you and slaps his forehead, but says nothing.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>8</ID>
      <DefaultText>For the first time, he turns his full attention toward you, and his eyes flicker in recognition. "Of course... that policy is for the general public. Exceptions can be made for those who have already proven their worth."</DefaultText>

      <ID>9</ID>
      <DefaultText>The man clears his throat. "We've had a number of inquiries about such information. I'm afraid we've had to bar access to the public.

"Seems there are still quite a number of folk in Dyrwood who bear ill will toward Readcerans. It would be irresponsible to surrender their names to just anyone - many came to settle here as refugees."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>10</ID>
      <DefaultText>"The Dyrwoodans' treatment of Readceran prisoners of war and refugees alike was deplorable."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I am a foreigner myself. I bear no grudges against Readceras."</DefaultText>

      <ID>14</ID>
      <DefaultText>There is something peculiar about the records keeper's inflection. The differences are subtle, but it does not sound like any native Dyrwoodan you've heard.

      <ID>15</ID>
      <DefaultText>As the records keeper gestures, you also notice faint scars on both his wrists where shackles once clasped. </DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>17</ID>
      <DefaultText>The records keeper frowns. "In the duc's palace? I can assure you that you do not.

"Besides, without my assistance, you'd be sifting through scrolls for years."</DefaultText>

      <ID>18</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Perhaps if you were more established in Defiance Bay, things would be different. But I have no reason to suspect you to be any different from the others."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I just need to find out about my brother. I don't even know what side he fought for."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Those scars on your wrists - you were a prisoner."</DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>23</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Was once. Now am happily free to do my job. Which, for you, I'm afraid, means you will have to seek your information elsewhere."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>25</ID>
      <DefaultText>His face twitches, as wincing at the memory of pain. He looks at you with questioning eyes.

He nods, looking away as he does so.

"It was, yes." The records keeper breathes a heavy sigh.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>26</ID>
      <DefaultText>He looks up at a shelf and withdraws a thick volume, shifting a layer of dust aside with his hand.

"The rosters are in the front, the inventories of the dead in back."

He passes it into Edér's outstretched hands.</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>27</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I will not permit any copying from these pages, do I make myself understood?"</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>28</ID>
      <DefaultText>He looks you in the eyes, squinting as if to see you more clearly.

"It is an unfortunate state of things when outsiders are easier to trust than one's own people."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>29</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Doesn't that just say it all?"</DefaultText>

      <ID>30</ID>
      <DefaultText>Edér leafs through the book for some time anxiously, running his thick farmhand's fingers over page after page of names.

At last, his hand stops, his fingers just below one name.</DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>31</ID>
      <DefaultText>He stops short, his eyes bulging. They scan back and forth, over and over.

"Readceras."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>32</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Woden Teylecg, Died 18 Majiverno, 2808. Third Battle of... Clee- Clee-ah- Clîaban Rilag.

    <Entry>
      <ID>33</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I'll be the Effigy. He fought for Readceras."

He stares at the page, his jaw agape before suddenly looking up at you.

"Why'd he fight for Readceras?"</DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>38</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I am too." He stares at the page, his complexion drained.

"I am too."</DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>39</ID>
      <DefaultText>"No no, not this. There's an answer. He always had a reason."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>40</ID>
      <DefaultText>"But that's just it. Woden always knew the right thing to do. If he fought for Waidwen, he's not the traitor. I am."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>41</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Either do I. But he had to have had a good reason. That's- That's just who he was."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>42</ID>
      <DefaultText>A strange look comes over Edér.

"We gotta go there. That battlefield. Clee-uh- The one I said. I don't know how else I'm gonna make sense of all this. I gotta see what he saw."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />

    <Entry>
      <ID>43</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Who knows, maybe his spirit'll even be there and you can have one of your weird talks with him.

"Worth trying, right?"</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>44</ID>
      <DefaultText>"We probably won't find anything."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>47</ID>
      <DefaultText>He nods, his eyes cast down, his smile a thin line. "I know."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>48</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I know what it is. You don't need to tell me."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>49</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I'd... hoped to see things through with your problem. But this is something I gotta do.
