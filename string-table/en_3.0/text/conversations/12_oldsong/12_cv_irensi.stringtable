      <DefaultText>An elven woman intercepts you as you advance into the lair. Behind her is the largest lioness you've ever seen: a sleek beast with fangs as long as carving knives.

The woman blocks your path to the lioness, seemingly at ease around the monster. "This is Sul's domain, estramor. She shall not leave it for Oernos or any other challenger."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I may be patient, but Sul isn't. Unless you have news about the bear's demise, you'd best keep your distance, lest you find yourself here during dinnertime."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Oernos is welcome to confront her here, as many challengers have in the past. What the bear's supporters want is for Sul to leave her lair and fight in the open, where he has an advantage. But why should she? If Sul has an advantage here, it's one she's earned. Would anyone expect to blunt the bear's claws in order to even the odds?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She looks at the lion with something between fondness and admiration. "Defending the rightful champion of Galawain's Maw. Oernos' supporters would have her ousted in favor of a bear that isn't strong enough to come and seize this territory on his own."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The lioness gives a low growl, and Irens√Æ smiles. "Also, Sul has recently given birth to cubs. They're small now, but when they grow, they'll be mightier than either Sul or Oernos. But if Sul is killed in combat, that bear will tear her young to shreds. Such is the way of the wild.

"Her legacy is too valuable to perish this way. If we truly want the mightiest of beasts in the Maw, then her cubs must grow to maturity."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I... hadn't thought of it that way." She looks at the lioness sadly. "Such a magnificent animal. I thought that protecting her served Galawain's will, but you're right. All are eventually both hunter and hunted in his sight. 

"We'll go. If Sul is truly worthiest, she doesn't need our help."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Good. That bear isn't nearly as strong as Einden and his followers think. If someone were to prove just how easily that bear can be killed, that would cure everyone of their delusions about it."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Hiravias glares at you with a worried smirk. "I wonder what Galawain will think of all this... his great lioness gets someone else to deal with her challenger?"

He falls silent for a moment before becoming instantly cheerful. "And I would love to watch someone other than me offend The Seeker God. I can't wait to see how he tests them for their lack of decisiveness."</DefaultText>
