      <DefaultText>"Did you think you wouldn't be recognized here, in your old home? I have seen your trials with my own eyes. I have seen you light pyres with good people tied to them. People I'd known many a year."

He seizes you by the throat, and your airway tightens, whether real or imagined you cannot tell. "They deserve your confession." He raises the point of his sword, holding it a hair's breadth from your eye.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Suros, what are you DOING?"

Startled, the soldier releases you immediately and turns to face the speaker, a woman in a plain wool tunic, fully a head shorter than he but somehow seeming to tower over him. You have seen this woman's face before, but from afar, bloodied and burned as she lay stretched across an iron wheel. At the moment, it is marked only with concern.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"If he is so poor an assassin as to approach an armed guard in daylight, I should have nothing to fear. I would hear what this man has to say."

She stares him down until he can no longer face her. He turns away, sour-faced, watching you through sidelong glances, his knuckles white around the pommel of his sword.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Iovara's eyes widen as she sees your face for the first time. "My own brother, returned home! I never dreamed this day would come."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText>You venture through the doorway and into a passage strewn with rubble. A spiraling staircase descends to a a lower level where a damp sea breeze mingles with centuries of dust.</FemaleText>

      <DefaultText>"So much has happened since then. The Inquisition..."

      <DefaultText>"Is that so? I meet so few these days. Many of my followers journey from other cities and kingdoms. And most of these soldiers were conscripted from the surrounding countryside.

      <DefaultText>She looks harder at you. "I DO remember you. It was years ago, when I was a missionary. Before all this." She shakes her head.

      <DefaultText>No longer able to remain quiet, the soldier approaches Iovara and puts his hand on her shoulder, turning her aside. His voice is hushed but by no means private.

"My Lady Iovara, I beg of you. This is an INQUISITOR! This is a desperate attempt on your life. The only way it can succeed is if you allow it to."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She brushes his hand away with the calm grace of the resolute. "This is a missionary, same as I was. Taught the wrong things, as I was.

      <DefaultText>"We have many former missionaries here. They are our most loyal, our most helpful. Many have died for us. These are not people we should be turning away.

"And if the Inquisition wants my life they can have it. But they know as well as I do that my cause will not die with me."</DefaultText>

      <ID>42</ID>
      <DefaultText>Iovara doesn't blink. "Are things as desperate as that over there? I'd never have known.
