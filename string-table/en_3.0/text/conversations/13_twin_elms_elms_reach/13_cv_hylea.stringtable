      <DefaultText>You shut your eyes to pray. As you wait in darkness, the world around you changes. You feel sunlight, bright and warm, on your face. A light breeze carries music to your ears. 

As vivid as these sensations feel, you somehow know they are not real.

You look around and find yourself standing in an open-air temple built on a mountain summit. It's filled with elves, orlans, and assorted other kith. Ringing the entire scene is a fringe of trees, their verdant branches filled with birds of all different colors, shapes, and sizes.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You kneel. While you pray, you feel the space around your body shift and melt, and you find yourself in a vision of the mountaintop temple. Yet you see neither worshipers nor a dragon, but a tree. 

Its limbs wrap around the perimeter of the temple, tapering into twigs and branches of all sizes and angles. They seem too long and too numerous to be held up by the meager trunk, but they hold steady in the breeze.

A single sparrow lands on the nearest branch. It watches you.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The fluttering wind carries a voice, gentle and soft. "You journeyed to my temple and found the dragon. Yet instead of driving it off, you allowed it to stay. The songs of my faithful will never again fill the Nest, and the beast and her young will slaughter many to feed their hunger."</DefaultText>

"And when you face Thaos and the rotting fruits of his endeavors, remember the conversation we have had. In that moment, you will have power rivaling a god's. And after it, you will live in the world that you have chosen."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Everyone is singularly absorbed in a particular pursuit. An orlan sits with a canvas, a paintbrush in his hand and jars of green, blue, and yellow pigments at his feet. An elf and an aumaua standing to the side are locked in conversation, their expressions dancing with delight.

Still others scribble stanzas of poetry or crude sketches on sheafs of paper, losing themselves in the delicate minutiae of lines and syllables. You feel the breeze again, and two elves basking in the sunlight shiver.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The largest group gathers in the middle of the temple. They sing a lush, chaotic harmony composed of several complimentary melodies. Others drift toward the singers in ones and twos as if buffeted by a gust of wind or a phrase of the song.

A ripple passes through the trees. You think it's the wind, but the chirping changes to screeching. Hundreds of birds take to the skies, all headed in one direction - away.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The devotees glance at the trees, just barely distracted from their activities. But the wind picks up, scattering their pages of poetry and art and ripping the songs from their lips. They look skyward, and you follow their gaze.

A dark shape blots out the sun. You can't tell what it is, but as it unfolds and expands, it seems to fill the sky. The wind roars over the summit.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Before you can flee, a shadow falls over the temple. It begins as a stain in the corner and spreads, blotting out the flagstones. 

It reaches the nearest kith, a black-furred orlan. The darkness swallows her, leaving only a puff of smoke in her place. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You look up again at the source of the shadow, but the eclipsed sun forms a blinding corona around the thing. You can't make out any details. 

You can, however, feel heat.

"Restore my temple."

You look down and find yourself standing next to Hylea's shrine in Teir Evron. Your pulse still races and your skin is damp with sweat from your strange encounter.</DefaultText>

Its limbs wrap around the perimeter of the temple, tapering into twigs and branches of all sizes and angles. They seem too long and too numerous to be held up by the meager trunk, but they hold steady in the breeze.

A single sparrow lands on the nearest branch. It watches you.</DefaultText>
