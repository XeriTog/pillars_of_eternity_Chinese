      <DefaultText>A mixture of curiosity and fear wells up between you. She raises her left hand, the chiming at her wrists quelling the rise within her... she is frightened, but curiosity anchors her.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>There is silence, and as your breath falls still, you hear the faint cry of a child in the distance, a newborn child, almost exactly like what you heard in the dream. 

As you listen, the Grieving Mother raises both her hands, as if weaving, her wrists chiming as she does so... in a semblance of the gentle turning she provided while the newborn was crowning... to your surprise, you recognize the motions and the words from the memory, even as they are new to you.</DefaultText>

      <ID>15</ID>
      <DefaultText>As she weaves her hands through the air in front of her, the child's cries grow still... yet the sound of the chimes weaves almost hypnotically into your thoughts. The sky seems sharp and clear... and you feel as if you are... towering over your surroundings, as if kneeling atop a great pillar... just as she did in the memory.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She leans back, as if looking back at the sky - but her eyes are closed, the film building on them. With a slow intake of breath, you feel time become quiet around you...</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I... do not feel the memory. I do not know if it is mine. But..."

Her hair falls across her features again like a veil, and she nods... not with her chin, but a push in her mind. "But thank you for trying."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>25</ID>
      <DefaultText>She shakes her head slowly, and her arms collapse, her hands falling against the ground...

The film of her eyes give way to tears that move slowly down her cheeks... but her expression doesn't change. You feel a well of... emptiness. Anguish... but more absence than sorrow.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>As you watch, her hands rise before her. She clasps them, then cups them, as if feeling them for the first time... and she stares down into the cradle of her hands... and the chimes sound once, twice, as they swing with the movement.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>There is a sudden intake of breath, and then... a release. Her eyes blur closed, forming into slits... but in the brief glimpse you have of her changing expression, the rippling pain in her features seems to have... smoothed. 

She swallows, once, twice... and then you feel her once again in your thoughts, the rasping husk of her voice swallowed and drawn within her. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"It was the Birthing Bell you saw." There is surprise...

      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>39</ID>
      <DefaultText>With the words comes a river of impulses, thoughts, as if loosed from a breaking dam... and as your mind wraps the impulses into words, you realize it is her muscles and her hardened thoughts relaxing and breathing again... 

...there is such an intensity you almost want to step back from the flow, but you find the wave of impulses cause questions to float to the surface.

Among them is a name - "Watcher."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Your help has allowed me to remember the Birthing Bell and the children born there. For these happy memories, I thank you."

Even as her gratitude laps at you, warm and placid, she shivers as if at a sudden breeze. For an instant, you feel raging winds, a bîaŵac, clawing at you.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The winds die, and a heavy fog seems to settle in the Grieving Mother's mind. 

"It is nothing."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>47</ID>
      <DefaultText>Something within her begins to open up, a ray of sunlight on a desolate landscape. 

"I do not exactly know. Of late I find my sleep beset with nightmares and my waking hours haunted by visions of... terrible things. Empty things.

"But these are delusions born of fear, nothing more."</DefaultText>

      <ID>48</ID>
      <DefaultText>The Grieving Mother's head bows, and she raises her hands, cradling them, slowly, so the chimes do not sound as she moves them. You feel a chill in the air, as if the vault of your mind is growing, too large for the thoughts within... and your breath is laced with a chill.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />

    <Entry>
      <ID>49</ID>
      <DefaultText>To your horror, you hear her breathing, ragged, hacking, but strangely steady... and you can see saliva bunching at the corners of her lips, becoming thick ropes of drool that cast themselves down her chin.

There is the smell of blood in the air, new, wet, and the salt... sharp tang in your mind. Coupled with this is the smell of sodden undergarments cloying at your senses.</DefaultText>

      <ID>57</ID>
      <DefaultText>Stepping forward, your hand falls on her shoulder... and then you feel her begin to fall, rigid as a falling stone, and you place your other hand on her shoulder to steady her. Throughout, there is the horrid, steady breathing.</DefaultText>

      <ID>59</ID>
      <DefaultText>Her clothes are wet... it is as if she is burning with fever beneath her tangled hair and beneath her threadbare robes... as if she is giving birth. 

With a slow hissing intake of breath, her head rolls back on her shoulders, her eyes pressed tightly together like the lids of a newborn. Yet past the lids, you can feel the piercing stare, vacant, cold... horribly, you sense nothing from her, not a thought, like the Hollowborn you held in her memory. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You know if you try and pull away now, she will vanish into herself, and vanish from your thoughts, perhaps forever... and you have a terrible feeling that whatever connects the two of you will be cut.

She is as helpless before you as a child, and you search your thoughts for a way to coax her to you.</DefaultText>
