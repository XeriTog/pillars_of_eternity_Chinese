      <DefaultText>You see four people gathered by the door to the inn. Their raised voices and chopping gestures suggest an argument reaching its climax.

The first figure raises his hands for calm. His face is partially obscured by a hood, but his height and stature suggest an elf.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The others, two folk men and an elven woman, don't look convinced. 

The woman crosses her arms. "Hoping to soothe our pride with a few Aedyre coppers, eh?" She spits at his feet. "We don't need your coin."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>One of the other men points at the hooded elf. His eyes are red from drink, but his gaze is focused. "Mocking us even while he shelters in our village. Just goes to show you what these fancy Aedyre manners are worth.

"We don't take to that kind of treatment. Not from foreigners, and 'specially not from Aedyrans."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The second man thrusts his chin at the elf. He stinks of sour ale. "Go on. Say it again. I'm itching for an excuse."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>One of the other men glares at the hooded elf. His eyes are red from drink, but his gaze is focused. "You've got a lot of gall, mocking us in our own village. We don't take ill treatment from foreigners. 'Specially not Aedyrans."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>One of the other men glares at the hooded elf. His eyes are red from drink, but his gaze is focused. "We're humble folk, but we're no fools.

      <DefaultText>Horror and shock paint themselves across the elven man's face in broad, hasty strokes. "This is a misunderstanding. I didn't say..." He frowns and swallows. "...whatever it is you think I said."

He plants his feet. Something surly and raw flickers through his eyes. "We've nye quarrel."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"He's reaching for something. And since it's not the rapier at his side, it's either a wand or a throwing dagger, and you don't look ready to deal with either."</DefaultText>

      <ID>36</ID>
      <DefaultText>They look at each other. One of the men gives the other two a warning shake of his head before turning to you. "We're done for now. But this one better watch his step around here because we're not going anywhere." With a final scowl at the elf, he turns to leave.</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>45</ID>

      <ID>46</ID>
      <DefaultText>He gives you a quick smile. "Courtesy is a rare pleasure in these parts. As is the company of a fellow countryman."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He straightens his hood, and you note the remains of fraying embroidery on his gloves. His boots are caked with the dirt of many months' travel, but the leatherwork beneath it is sturdy and fine. </DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>51</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I'm a wizard by training and an adventurer by necessity. I was born in the Cythwood, part of the mainland of the Aedyr Empire. Both of my parents served the nobility, which afforded me an education for which I'm grateful. However, there were no open positions in those houses, and so I decided to seek new means in a new land."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>52</ID>
      <DefaultText>"An excellent question." He folds his arms and frowns, looking toward the center of town. "I came looking for fresh air and cheap land. Instead, the magistrate gave me directions to the inn and a story about the local lord's expectant wife." He cocks his head, looking at you. "But I take it that's a familiar tale."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>54</ID>
      <DefaultText>A sly grin crosses his lips. "Begging your pardon, but neither do you. Yet circumstances can find a person in the strangest of places."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>55</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I'm afraid that was a matter of misunderstandings and mistranslations." He tents his fingers and looks away. "It doesn't help that people in these parts remember their war with Aedyr like it was yesterday."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>56</ID>
      <DefaultText>"You did tell that one man to go fuck his sister."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />

    <Entry>
      <ID>57</ID>
      <DefaultText>"You did make a rather lewd suggestion regarding one of the aggressors and his own sister."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I see."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>59</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Ah. That." He clears his throat and adjusts his sleeves. "As I tried to tell them, they misheard me. Happens all too easily after a few pints, and the accent doesn't help."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>60</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I heard the same thing."</DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>61</ID>
      <DefaultText>For just a moment, he looks as if he's about to say something else. His expression brightens with mischief, but before he can speak, he forces a tight smile, biting his lip so hard you expect to see blood. Finally, his face relaxes, and he shakes his head. 

"I should speak more clearly next time. My apologies."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />

    <Entry>
      <ID>62</ID>

      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>67</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I should get going."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>69</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Indeed." His eyes flicker across you and your travel-worn clothing. "In that case, welcome to Gilded Vale. A true refuge from civilization."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>70</ID>
      <DefaultText>His eyes flicker as he looks you up and down. "Indeed? The local lord has searched far and wide for similar specialists. He has rid himself of them almost as desperately." He nods at the gnarled old tree in the center of town.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>71</ID>
      <DefaultText>His eyes flicker wide. "Keep your voice down. Whenever suspicion seizes the locals, they tend to seize whoever's nearest." He nods at the gnarled old tree in the center of town.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>72</ID>
      <DefaultText>His gaze darts downward. "Of course. I didn't mean to pry." He nods at the gnarled old tree in the center of town. "If there was ever a place for caution, this is it."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>73</ID>
      <DefaultText>"As should I, given recent events. It's just as well. I've had enough of the watered wine and lumpy beds at the inn." He wrinkles his nose. "They say even the owner tired of the place. Just up and left one day. It explains quite a lot about the upkeep."

He gives you a guardedly hopeful look. "Perhaps I could join you. I could use a change of scenery, and I find it's better to travel in numbers."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>78</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I quite understand." He looks back at the inn with a sigh. "A few more nights of stringy stew won't kill me, I suppose. Though if that dog goes missing, I may have to fast."</DefaultText>
