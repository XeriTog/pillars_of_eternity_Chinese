      <DefaultText>Just off the side of the path into Caed Nua stands an imposing figure: a tall, thick-set aumaua, clad in worn armor and peering up at the outer walls of the keep. In his hand is a small piece of charcoal, and it works feverishly at taking notes upon a small scrap of paper. More than once he has to reach up to prevent his colorful cap from falling off his head as he gazes upwards. </DefaultText>

"There are names scratched upon some of the bricks, just there. Workers and masons, I expect. Carving a little immortality for themselves." He looks up at the wall again, expression fond. "It's a fine keep, Caed Nua. Two centuries to its name... and abandoned for nearly as long." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Kana is singing some low and merry tune under his breath. His face is smudged with smears of charcoal where he has touched it. He turns toward you as you approach, flashing another cheerful and alarming smile.
