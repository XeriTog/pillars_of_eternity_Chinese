      <DefaultText>"So uh... [Player Name]... are you feeling okay? Did you catch alcoholism from the Dyrwoodans?" His smile turns nervous as he looks you over, examining you for signs of injury.

      <DefaultText>As you regain awareness of what's happening around you, you realize that your head is in Pallegina's feathered hands. Her golden eyes are peering into your own, as though she is trying to catch a glimpse of activity lurking in the depths.

As she sees your eyes respond, she wobbles your head a little and gives you a light slap.

Letting go and stepping back, she regards you with concern. "Everything going all right in there?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He raises an eyebrow. "Indeed? At the risk of sounding patronizing... you should probably have that examined."

He scratches his cheek. "It's a shame that Lord Raedric's hanged half of Gilded Vale. The Vailian dwarf might have known something about your condition."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She watches you quietly. "You really are a Watcher, aren't you? 

"Once in a great many generations, one of my people is born with the ability to speak to souls. Usually, such individuals become elders... or a lone set of tracks in the snow."

She cocks her head. "I would've thought my journey would be easier if I could see what you see. But looking at you, I'm not so sure." </DefaultText>
