      <DefaultText>"The ritual was... one of many steps, it took many tens of years to carve them... but always the child's thoughts were there to guide me, from the moment it began to awaken... to the three seasons within the mother, to the birthing day... and the years to follow.

"I would sound the memory of the Birthing Bell atop the plateau in her mind, letting the memory of the vibrations fill my thoughts - and hers. 

"Often, the child's soul could hear it, too, so the sound of the Bell... echoed in the mother's thoughts. "</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"There was much I could do to aid the mother... some sought the physical comforts of ritual to steady their thoughts - even adra from the Bell.

There is a slow chill, and for a moment, it seems as if she is going to fade from your vision... as if she can't bear to be seen... and there is a spike of fear, alarm...</DefaultText>

Oddly enough, it feels like she's not speaking to you... it feels like she's speaking to an audience. The air takes on a curious edge, a chill, which persists for a sharp moment... then fades into a dull fear.

      <DefaultText>As the thought of Watchers crosses your mind, you feel a sharp pain... stabbing... and the sudden burn of lashes across your back and shoulder... and then it is gone... and you feel the Grieving Mother before you, silent... almost fearful, wary.</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>158</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I was something else, but because the title 'Watcher' was cast on me, the word carried a weight I had neither earned nor deserved.

      <DefaultText>"The world has many corners, and in some corners, the name Watcher is... more known. It is an easier title than others, and at times, it is easier to wear.

"Placing a title upon what is unknown can dispel the fear of it... and I did not fight it. I even believed it true, though I knew little of the ways of Watchers. 

"It even... granted me strength."</DefaultText>

      <ID>161</ID>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>163</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I... drew upon the present. I felt the soul of the mother before me... and used that to tell the child's path, to give it a voice.

"If only the thoughts of the mother and the emotions that lie beneath were mine to impart, I did... and... so I used that as the telling of their child's future."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>165</ID>

      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>166</ID>
      <DefaultText>"And their lives I knew well. I could weave their lives, their thoughts over time - to the mother, to the child - and once the child had been born, was sheltered... I could relax the threads of thought until the child could stand on its own."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>167</ID>

    <Entry>
      <ID>170</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Even... the most strongly worded tells may not be enough to save a child and allow it to be born...

      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>171</ID>
      <DefaultText>"And with the weight of 'Watcher' behind my thoughts, these tells gained strength... strength I never possessed on my own. They believed.

      <ID>172</ID>
      <DefaultText>"You must understand... without such weight upon my words... many lives would have been lost. Drowned, cast in the Lake beyond the Bell. Now the trail to the Lake is lost and reclaimed by the forest... as was meant. 

"A Watcher was not there to look over us, but it was a Watcher that saved them... and with a Watcher's strength, children were born, were cared for, and grew strong."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"My hands have always been quick to guide, Watcher... to draw a child from the womb, to ease a mother's pain... it is not my way to stand aside.

"But the ebb and flow of birthing pains is as the turning of the Wheel. A new birth, a new chance, a new life... once this ill has run its course. Perhaps this is where our hopes must lie."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Yes, and for years after. I gave a set to the child after delivery. It is a reminder of the memory the mother and child shared." 

You feel an odd sensation, a warmth, and you can feel a smile being shared, then it flickers, and it is gone.
