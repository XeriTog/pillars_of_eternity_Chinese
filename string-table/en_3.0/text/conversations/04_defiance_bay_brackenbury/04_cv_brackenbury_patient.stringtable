      <DefaultText>A curved spine twists this woman's posture forward, her greasy hair draped over her large eyes like vines. She smiles at you.

"You must be visiting someone."

Then, noting your appearance, she adds, "A friendly visit, I hope."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Oh I like him very much. Many animancers could care less about their patients. Look at us like vermin for their experiments. But Master Azo treats us like humans, even the very sick. You can tell he does this to help people.

"He's helped me understand a great deal about myself and I know he's done the same for others. It's too bad what they did to him. He hides it well, but I know he's still affected by it."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText> "Well, there's Battixa who relives a murder she committed more than five lifetimes ago. Idelman, who they say only has half a soul and who was found collecting the faces of others because he believed his own to be a false one.

      <DefaultText>Freyol's eyes dart back and forth, and her voice lowers to just above a whisper.

"They don't like to talk about it... but there was an accident.

      <DefaultText>"People say it was ego that drove him to try and solve the Legacy, but that's hogwash, even if he was a bit of a showman. He loves his homeland. He thought he could help.

"He wasn't one to speak of his work - suspected his colleagues might have tried to steal it. But he told me once that he had figured out a way to create a soul."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>24</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Not a soul exactly, mind you. How did he put it? A proxy, I think he called it. Had some machine that drew energy out of the very ether. Can you imagine?

"The point is, it was going to help with the Legacy. It was going to make Hollowborn into something easier to love and care for. Gods know, that's something we need. Do you know what they call those empty little babies in Ondra's Gift?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"And then the next day, he was locked in his office. Turning away visitors, I heard. And he stopped seeing patients. I don't know exactly what happened, and I don't have the heart to ask him. But I'm glad they're letting him treat people again."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"These last few years haven't been kind to me. They haven't been kind to anyone, really. I try not to think of it as personal. 

"I lost my husband and both boys in the Saint's War. My daughter, the Legacy took her before she was ever mine.

      <DefaultText>"I moved into a tiny place in Ondra's Gift, got by mending clothes and on the kindness of strangers when I had to. But I was surviving and the gods were watching over me. I could live with that.

"Then one day this noblewoman comes in, wants this fancy gown fixed. Gorgeous thing, this shade of blue I'd never seen before. Only I had. I looked at it, and it reminded me of something. I had what they call an Awakening."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>35</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I remembered being a noblewoman myself in another life. People doting over me, MEN doting over me. Me! The best food, the most beautiful home, all the things you'd never dare to dream of. They were mine.

"It was poison, knowing that. All those things I had that I'll never have in this life. It did something to me. My food started to taste rotten. The walls in my little room seemed to close in around me. I stopped being able to sleep in my own bed."

      <DefaultText>"So I came here. It was that or break into an estate and start ordering servants around.

"It seems like such a silly thing to worry about. You don't have to tell me. But I can't get past it. And I start to wonder - did the gods choose this life for me? And if so, what terrible thing must I have done to deserve it?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Freyol sighs. "Maybe they did. I wish I had known, back when I was noble. Maybe I'd have done things differently."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Well yes, I suppose... but nothing they didn't volunteer for. Master Azo let us know that a number of patients in the North Ward had volunteered for a new therapy and would be escorted to his laboratory to receive treatment. 

"The North Ward has our most troubled cases. I'm glad some of them have chosen to get help. It seems to me it's gotten quieter over there since it started."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"They like to keep them separate. I don't know that I've ever seen the guards allow a visitor. Just Master Azo.
