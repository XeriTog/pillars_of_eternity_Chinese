      <DefaultText>The woman must be well into middle age, but there isn't a line on her face. Her large, green eyes are watchful behind a curtain of glossy black hair. She studies you. "I don't believe we've met. I'd remember you."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She narrows her eyes. "I don't know who told you that, but even if it were true, you're asking for a favor. And I only do favors for friends." 

She leans in, pursing her painted lips. "But we could be friends. I just need a little something from you first."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She crosses her arms and watches you out of the corner of her eyes. "There's a certain someone who may or may not be named Kolfecg. He's insulted me. I'd like you to make an example out of him."</DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>14</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I'd hate to stifle your imagination." She wrinkles her nose with a quick smirk. "Just see that you teach him a lesson he won't soon forget."</DefaultText>

      <ID>15</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I suppose I could help."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>16</ID>
      <DefaultText>"That's the spirit." She winks.

"I know that little runt holes up somewhere in Ondra's Gift. Once you've taken care of him, come back to me. I've got some stocks that I reserve for special friends."</DefaultText>

      <ID>21</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Oh, my." Her green eyes dilate. "That would be interesting. If only my husband weren't in the next room."

She runs a long-nailed finger along your arm. "Not that I don't appreciate the offer, but I'm thinking of a different kind of favor."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>26</ID>
      <DefaultText>She looks you up and down. "Let's just say I'm a merchant. I handle the trade of certain goods that my enterprising children and husband happen across."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>27</ID>
      <DefaultText>"But I only trade with special friends. And if you want that kind of relationship, you'd have to do a little something for me."</DefaultText>

      <ID>34</ID>
      <DefaultText>"That makes me very glad, indeed." She draws one crimson fingernail to her lips. "Tell me about it. Don't leave out a single detail." She nibbles the tip of her fingernail.</DefaultText>
