      <DefaultText>A young woman leans against a wagon. One arm and one side of her face are covered in bandages, with raw, rippled flesh showing underneath. A minty, tangy scent wafts from her dressing.

She smiles painfully. "Just ventured into town? I'm 'bout dry on some of my stocks, but you're welcome to have a look-see."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>A noise of disgust rattles from her throat. "Brigands, looters, you name it. The gods may be hollowing out our babies, but it's grown folk that's rubbing out the rest of us."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She adjusts one of her bandages. "Anything else I can do for you? I've got some handy ointments if you're braving the roads anytime soon."</DefaultText>

      <ID>32</ID>
      <DefaultText>"It's the damn roads. Can't reach none of my suppliers, so I'm stuck with whatever I can scrounge up in the wood. Dyrcap, River Reed, and the like.

"That's well and good, but most potions require something stronger, too. Troll skin, vessel bone, what have you. And then there's the really rare ingredients, things you'd never be able to afford, let alone find on your own..." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Hendyna winces as the rest of the story comes tumbling out of her. "I been keeping an eye on a drake's nest east of town, at Dyrford Crossing. The beast stayed just long enough to lay a clutch and moved on. Thank the Sky Mother it wasn't a full-grown dragon." </DefaultText>

      <ID>35</ID>
      <DefaultText>She keeps her gaze steady, but you see hope kindling in her eyes and twitching at the corners of her mouth. "I sure hope you're not leading me on. I don't think I could stand getting burned again."

She bites her lip. "If you really mean to go after it, I'd certainly pay you. Just remember, big as they are, dragon eggs are fragile. And there's a lot more I can do with a whole one."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Amazing. Not a single crack." She runs her bandaged hand across the shell.</DefaultText>

      <ID>42</ID>
      <DefaultText>"A little worse for wear." She runs her bandaged hand across a crack in the shell. "Still, it's a rare find. Thank you."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>43</ID>
      <DefaultText>She frowns at the gunk seeping out of the broken shell. "Better get to work on this 'fore it's just an expensive puddle at our feet."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>46</ID>
      <DefaultText>She hefts the egg into the back of her wagon and rummages among her shelves. "Here, take this." She drops a stack of coins and a parcel of ingredients into your hands. "Everything you need to brew a good, strong pick-me-up. Should come in handy with the kind of scrapes you seem to get into."

She leans closer. "And come see me any time you need potions or ingredients, all right? I got a special price for friends." She winks.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"She was so queasy she didn't even notice Trygil's... odor." She tugs at a bandage. "I wouldn't normally say nothing, but that girl was with child.
