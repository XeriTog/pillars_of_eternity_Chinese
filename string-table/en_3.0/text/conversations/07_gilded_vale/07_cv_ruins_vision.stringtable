      <DefaultText>For an instant, the apparatus goes quiet and the air is still. Then, all at once, it erupts with a concussive surge. Light floods your vision, and you are knocked to the ground. Your head snaps back as you land, and pain wells into the back of your skull, washing your last thoughts away into the black unconscious void.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You open your eyes to a different place, another time. You stand in a circular room, grand and domed, its walls lined with adra and trimmed with copper. The style is ancient, but the chamber is unweathered. 

At the far end a great pillar of adra pierces the floor from below, its shimmering texture giving the illusion of boundless depth.

Encircling the pillar is an apparatus much like the one you have just seen, but immense and multifaceted and intertwined.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>At the base of the pillar now, you see a man with a thick gray beard in ceremonial robe, crowned with a strange ornamental headdress. 

You know this man. You are walking towards him now at a pace that is hurried while trying not to appear so.

You have something you want to ask him, one question above all, and the question spins madly in your mind...</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You awaken to find your malaise has broken, only to be replaced with something far more concerning. Faint whispers are audible at the edge of your hearing, like a ringing in your ears that does not subside.

Movement flits through your periphery, but when you turn to look, you can see no sign of whatever it was. You find your gaze regularly darting this way and that, an involuntary paranoid tic. If this is a sickness, it may be dangerous to go without treatment for long.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You find Calisca lying prostrate a short distance away, blood pooled beneath her head. No breath escapes her lips.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You are alone and far from help. Gilded Vale may be your best hope of receiving treatment before things get worse.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The figures at the machine stand frozen in place, flesh and blood replaced by cinders and ash. The man who led them is nowhere to be seen.</DefaultText>
