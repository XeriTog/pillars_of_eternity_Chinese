      <DefaultText>This young man's face is badly bruised, and his gaunt form is covered in a threadbare shirt. He watches you, shivering, with a measure of hope in his eyes. "I don't know who you are, but... will you help me?" </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Nedmar...?" Giacco gives a quiet laugh of disbelief. "The priest sent you? I thought..." </DefaultText>

      <ID>12</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Well, I thought he'd leave me here to rot. He wasn't too happy when I left the keep. I told him I could do far more good with Kolsc than as an acolyte. He accused me of joining a band of outlaws." Giacco looks down at his feet. "I guess we were both wrong." </DefaultText>

      <ID>13</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Yes." He looks away. "It seemed a good plan. We got in without incident, and I knew the way. But we were surprised in the dungeons. And most of us..." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Giacco shudders. "You'll have seen some of them. Fought them. Their bodies, at least. Not their minds, anymore. But their souls..."</DefaultText>

      <ID>15</ID>
      <DefaultText>"The woman down here - Raedric's animancer... Her name is Osrya. I've heard her speaking, sometimes, talking about a cure. Lord Raedric calls on her often. But she's not curing anyone. She's only turned men and women into monsters." He shudders. "I watched her take the others. I was sure I'd be next." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"P-please don't leave me here." Giacco shivers. "What if something comes back?" </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Nedmar's been a father to me, really. My actual father was a trader, and he died in a bandit raid when I was young. I don't remember him much. I remember the days after, though - stuck here in Gilded Vale, begging for food." </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />

    <Entry>
      <ID>20</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Nedmar was a priest of the Scattered God back then. He took me in, and raised me in the church. I was going to follow in his footsteps. Even after he converted, and we turned to the Twinned God." </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>21</ID>
      <DefaultText>"But I started seeing what was happening to Gilded Vale - what Raedric was doing. And Nedmar, he just kept on saying that things would work out. That we had to stand by the lord of the keep. Kolsc was the only one who seemed to be willing to do anything about it, instead of... well, preaching." He smiles sadly. "So that's two fathers I've left behind." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"There's something not right about her. A bad feeling, I mean. I knew the moment she arrived, things would take a turn for the worse." he shivers. "There's nothing good comes of dealing with animancers. Unnatural, the lot of them." </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>23</ID>
      <DefaultText>"She's the one who transformed them. Changed my friends into monsters. Said she was doing it for the good of Gilded Vale." Giacco clenches a fist. "More like the good of her coinpurse and her sick curiosity."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>24</ID>
      <DefaultText>"She's dangerous. And who knows what else she's got in her laboratory. I wouldn't go in there. She... she has a convincing manner. Spells, no doubt." </DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>26</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Thank you, stranger! I have to get back to the Fork... but first some food and rest, I think." He hesitates. "If you would dare the upper floors, please tell Nedmar I live yet. Tell him... tell him I still have the carving he gave me, of the Pale Knight. That should convince him, and perhaps he can help you somehow." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Giacco seems much improved for his time out of the dungeons, though a few fading bruises linger. "It's good to see you again. I don't know if I can ever really thank you enough for your help." </DefaultText>

      <ID>31</ID>
      <DefaultText>Giacco stares at you bleakly. "Why? Why have you done this? You know what Raedric is capable of. You could have changed everything. And now you've taken what hope we had." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Giacco hesitates, glancing towards the door - but only for a moment. "May your soul splinter beneath the Wheel," he hisses, running past you. "Gods forbid we meet again." </DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>41</ID>
      <DefaultText>"What?" Giacco's smile fades. He glances at Kolsc, where he stands speaking with one of his men. Giacco lowers his voice. "W-what have you done?" </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Getting here was a little more exciting than I'd hoped, what with all the wolves. But Kolsc and the others have been helping me. I'll be back in the thick of it soon enough." He smiles brightly. "And then maybe I can return the favor, right?" </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Giacco breathes in sharply, surprised, before sagging with relief. "Good. She deserved far worse. Maybe with her gone, the people she's changed can pass on to the next life. I hope so, anyway." </DefaultText>
