      <DefaultText>"I will not allow my lands to fall into ruin. I will cleanse the Scattered God's poison from the blood of my people. I will scour his name from the Dyrwood. Berath has blessed me with its favor, and I will be its sword. There will be no more mercy for the heretic, the thief, the charlatan. All will meet with death."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Would that you had shown such honor before. You would have cast the Vale into a darker age. Left it rudderless, leaderless. What purpose did you have in killing us both? Did you think the title would fall to you? That what few riches I have not bestowed upon my people would sate your greed?" </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Do not speak to me of justice." The glowing fires of Raedric's eyes burn white with rage. "I decide what is just within my lands. I am lord of the Vale. And you are but a passing pestilence upon the world." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>An armored figure strides forward. In place of its eyes, great flames burn, emanating heat and light. In that orange glow you can see that the face beneath has succumbed to rot - the cheeks sunken, the lips pulled back over gray gums and decaying teeth. But it is unmistakably Raedric who stands before you. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Look well." Raedric's voice has gained a scratchy quality, but retains its stolid arrogance. "See what you have made of me. But see too what great Berath has permitted. I am returned, mind and soul, so that I might be avenged upon my enemies." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I have strangled the life from the usurper Kolsc with my own hands." He raises a fist in demonstration, clenching rotting fingers. "So fell your champion. Your great hope." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Are you struck wordless?" Raedric chuckles, his teeth bared. "It is... a ghastly thing, to step beyond the Shroud. To be dragged back, and tethered to a rotting shell. You will only have a taste of what I have suffered, before it passes." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"And I am glad for it. I have sent servants forth to observe your progress. I feared your soft heart might falter. But you have proven your valor in this, at least." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I would have harried you across the earth, had you not come. Across the very sea. You may have cut my mortal life from me, but now Berath stands with me. I cannot be defeated." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Then your eyes are deceived. You cannot imagine the power bestowed upon me. I feel the touch of the gods. My faith is a font from which I draw life. My wrath is a sweeping flame. And you will burn this day." </DefaultText>

      <ID>26</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I have been brought back to exact Berath's vengeance upon the mortal world. This is no waste. Know that I will cleave your head from your shoulders, wretch, and send you cleanly from this world. May the next life provide you with more wisdom than you have shown in this one." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Raedric laughs, a low and unsettling sound. "Then kneel, coward, and I will strike your head off. You will meet no kinder end than that." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"You would have cast the Vale into a darker age. Left it rudderless, leaderless. Kolsc did not know what beast he sought to tame, did he? What twisted and thrice-cracked soul had come to sow the seeds of Gilded Vale's downfall."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>For a moment, Raedric hesitates. And then he raises his blade in salute. "Then fight well. We will see which of Berath's champions proves the victor!" </DefaultText>
