      <DefaultText>The light rises from the bones as you approach. You have a moment to register the faintest image of a standing figure, features a blur of mist or smoke, before the world tilts...</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Skeletons cover the floor, frozen in their final moments of agony. You feel a presence in the air, like a physical weight.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>At one edge of this gruesome tableau, one set of remains seems to glow with a peculiar light. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You are too tired to do harm. The thirst is like fire within you. Your tongue is thick in your throat, and every breath is a struggle that leaches strength from you. There is a light, they said, at the end of every bout of darkness. But this one does not end. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The spirit releases you, and you come back to yourself, in pieces. Your vision clears, and the vault around you is revealed once more, cast in muted hues by the sickly illumination of the soul still drifting like fading fog. Fear wafts off the spirit in waves, fraying at your own emotions. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You feel a dulled pulse of anger from the soul... and then, relief. The energy you feel recedes, and the lights drift outward, then fade. The spirit is gone. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You feel a lashing coil of anger and fear from the soul, before it floats, downward, to settle by the remains. It does not move toward you again. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The spirit seems to withdraw into itself. You sense less of its fear and confusion as it recedes, but the soul lingers still.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You run around and past the shallow reflection pool that marks the lowest point of the temple, following the dark shapes of the older priests as they lead the way towards the narrow hall that leads to the vault. You pass one of the torchbearers as you go. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>It is as if you have stepped sideways and into a new life. You are racing down a flight of stairs, following a weaving circle of torchlight. Your own panting breaths are loud in your ears. Panic and your robes alike foul your steps, and you nearly stumble before a hand reaches out to grip your arm and steady you - a fellow acolyte, who smiles encouragement as you reach the bottom. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The harsh illumination of the flames reveals a familiar face. For a moment your awareness spans time and identity, and you think Wirtan has joined you, here at the bottom of the temple. In the memory, he glances at you for a moment, and then looks past, at someone else. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I'll come back, once they're gone," he's saying. You're being pressed along by the crowd, and his words are growing faint. "Just keep quiet. We can't take any chances." Inside the vault, golden relics gleam like welcoming stars. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The memory twists, jarring you loose from one moment and plunging you into another like a flung doll. There is only darkness around you now. You think yourself blinded, until the knowledge settles onto you like a cloak - the candles have all burnt away.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>There is a cracking noise, somewhere to your left. A wet, slurping gurgle, and a ragged sob. You cannot see, and so you cannot know which brother or sister has fallen, and which digs after what water a body may provide. You hear, in the faint murmuring to your right, the familiar cadence of prayer. But you no longer recognize the words. </DefaultText>
