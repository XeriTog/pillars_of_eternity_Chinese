      <DefaultText>A man skulks near the bar. He seems like he's trying to blend in with the wood paneling, and he watches the other patrons out of the corner of his eye. He gives you a quick nod as you approach.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He glances around and snatches the pouch from you. "Keep your voice down, will you? The Doemenels have spies everywhere."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Messy business with Verzano and the Doemenels. Now you can see why I stay out of it."</DefaultText>

      <ID>28</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Bitter squash seeds. They interrupt pregnancies. Even though they're not exactly legal, many folk nowadays prefer them to the risk of Hollowborn. Or celibacy." He pulls a wry frown.</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>29</ID>
      <DefaultText>He tucks the pouch away. "You tell Verzano this is the last time I'm buying from him. This is getting too dangerous for me."</DefaultText>

      <ID>30</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Um... no?" He grins weakly.</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>33</ID>
      <DefaultText>"You have no idea, do you? Let's just say that the Doemenels have, uh, 'exclusive' rights to trade certain merchandise within the city.

"Verzano likes to make some extra coin from time to time by dealing in the same merchandise. Undercutting the competition, he says."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"There's no hiding from the Doemenels in Defiance Bay. I never should have trusted that damned Vailian..."</DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>37</ID>
      <DefaultText>"The more important thing is making sure they don't hear of you. They're old Brackenbury stock, but these days the Doemenels are known for their business activities. Most of which involve some degree of bribery, extortion, theft, or murder."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Right."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>39</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Of course. You're standing by yourself in the corner of a tavern, and you're not drinking anything. Not suspicious at all."</DefaultText>

      <ID>40</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Maybe I should ask some of these other patrons what that business is..."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Gareth's nervous eyes dart around the room. "Keep it down, will you? I really am here to do business, but it's the kind of thing that requires discretion. And unless a mutual friend has sent you to me, that's all I've got to say on the subject."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>42</ID>
      <DefaultText>"And if you don't want a scene, you'll tell me what that means."</DefaultText>

      <ID>43</ID>
      <DefaultText>He glances around and snatches the pouch from you. "Glad Verzano finally picked someone with a bit of discretion. Guess he's finally realized the Doemenels are onto him."</DefaultText>
