      <DefaultText>A woman swaggers in, her polished boots thwacking the floor with slow, deliberate steps. A crooked sneer warps her smooth face. 

"Gareth, I'm hurt. You promised to buy only from me. What's a girl to think?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Gareth bows, his knees knocking together. "Please, my lady, I was just explaining that I don't do business with anyone else-" </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Except this one last time, right?" Danna crosses her arms and rocks back on her heels. "There's always one more deal. Until you run out of credit, that is."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Danna turns and regards you, looking you up and down. "And just who are you? You don't exactly look like a seed dealer."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"You've got pluck, but don't try to hold out on me. Especially not when I'm inclined to let you off the hook."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>10</ID>
      <DefaultText>Her grin widens. "I just might have a use for someone like you."</DefaultText>

      <ID>11</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Verzano put you up to this, didn't he? That old fool's on a sinking ship, and he's determined to drag anyone who gets close enough down with him."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Leave me out of this."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>13</ID>
      <DefaultText>She laughs. "Like it or not, you've put yourself in the middle of a rather awkward situation."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>14</ID>
      <DefaultText>She eyes the trembling Gareth. "Gareth here knew better, but I'll give you the benefit of the doubt. In fact, I'll also give you a chance to get even with the imbecile who's been playing us both." 

She narrows her eyes. "What do you say to killing Verzano?"</DefaultText>

      <ID>16</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Why wouldn't you? He's used you to do his dirty work, and without telling you anything about what you were carrying... or who you were crossing."

She taps a finger to her jaw, and her voice slows. "Of course, I'd also consider it a personal favor. And House Doemenel is never stingy with its friends." She glances at Gareth. "The loyal ones, anyway."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />

      <DefaultText>"I don't know whether to be relieved or insulted. We're one of the wealthiest merchant families in Defiance Bay. 

"Let's just say, however, that some of our business practices are not officially sanctioned."

Gareth groans and stifles a sob.</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>20</ID>
      <DefaultText>She flicks a gloved hand at you. "Then scurry back to Verzano and get your payment while you still can. Just make sure you stay out of my way."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>21</ID>
      <DefaultText>"All right, I'll do it."</DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>22</ID>
      <DefaultText>She nods. "We don't forget a favor any sooner than we forget a betrayal. You take care of this, and I'll see to it that my family knows your name."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I've got a sharp and ready blade here that says you won't. And even if you did, you'd have all of House Doemenel howling for your blood."

She speaks carefully. "I guarantee that's not a problem you want."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Danna draws her blade. "Be thankful you won't live to regret this."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>29</ID>
      <DefaultText>"You'd better make up your mind quickly, because we're going to pay him his dues one way or another. Just make sure you stay out of our way."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>30</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I get the sense that throwing threats around is second nature to you. I admire that, and I just might have a use for someone like you."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Aloth glances at Gareth. "I think that's a compliment."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>32</ID>
      <DefaultText>She laughs. "You've gotten yourself entangled in just about every other mess in the city. Why make an exception now?"</DefaultText>
