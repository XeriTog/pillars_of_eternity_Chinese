      <DefaultText>A lone figure in tattered robes shuffles across the chamber, muttering under its breath. As you approach, the figure halts and swivels its head toward you.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Its haggard visage is a labyrinth of wrinkles and sores overgrown by a moss-like beard.

"What's this? Who disturbs Helig's work?" Its voice rattles and gurgles like that of a drowning man.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He leans back and bursts into raucous laughter. His threadbare robes drift apart, revealing an amulet - and a ragged wound running from chest to throat. It spatters a black, viscous fluid on the floor with every cackle. </DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>39</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Only that it's a miracle - or a joke - of the gods that he's still alive." He picks a bloodied crust from his beard. "The only thing he loved more than his fetching lieutenant was the idea of his own legend."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>75</ID>
      <DefaultText>He places his hands on the table and leans forward. "Tell me everything. The look on his face. The sound of his screams." He closes his eyes and clasps his gnarled hands together. "I want to bask in every glorious detail."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Helig bursts into laughter, spewing bilious fluid. He dances a halting, awkward caper before settling his mad eyes on you again.

"I doubt I've ever had this much fun, even in life." He removes his amulet and hands it to you. "And now, your reward."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>82</ID>
      <DefaultText>"You asked for Rowyna, and here she is. Small enough to carry with you." He chuckles again. "She was a formidable warrior, and now her soul is a formidable talisman. It's served me well these years, but I've moved on to bigger and better things." He waves a hand at the texts and runes on his table.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I was one of the first animancers in the Dyrwood. Practiced necromancy, too, which is what put Dalton and his Northwatch Rangers on my trail." He cackles, making a wet, burbling sound.</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>87</ID>
      <DefaultText>"When animancy started gaining popularity, I came to Defiance Bay in hopes of finding a place where my research would meet with more acceptance. Worked at the Brackenbury Sanitarium for a few months when I met Moedred." He spits a glob of black blood on the floor.</DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>90</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Let's just say Moedred and I didn't see eye to eye. Got so bad we were threatening to kill each other on a daily basis. Obviously, that bastard made good on his threat." He runs a jagged fingernail along his oozing wound. "Sank a dagger into my chest while I was sleeping and dumped my body in the catacombs."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>93</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I'd preserved my mind and my memories with Engwithan magic and a few timely preparations."

He looks at his rotting hands. "Yet now my soul is anchored to this decaying husk."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>94</ID>
      <DefaultText>His claw-like hands clench into fists. "Moedred stole a life from me and left me with this wrecked corpse. And this craving." He clutches at his stomach and glances at you hungrily, but only for a second.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>95</ID>
      <DefaultText>"In the Brackenbury district. Most of the animancy research in the city begins and ends there. My experiments made some of the other animancers... uncomfortable, but they bore fruit, and I was left to my work without interference. That is, by everyone save Moedred."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>96</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Even so, it merely anchored my soul to this decaying husk. Nothing like the life that was stolen from me." Helig lets out a rattling sigh. 

"And yet you see what a little Engwithan magic can do. My mind is my own, my memory is fresh, and my work can continue. And Moedred..." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Now, like so many things, it passes to the next generation. Use it as you see fit, or give it to that miserable old sap, Dalton."

He shrugs his bony shoulders and returns to his work. "Whatever you decide, our business is ended."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>106</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Did he mention that they hunted me down like a rabid dog?" He adjusts his moth-eaten robes. "I just wanted to continue my studies. Attitudes towards animancy were not what they are now. And necromancers have never met with much acceptance." </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>107</ID>

    <Entry>
      <ID>113</ID>
      <DefaultText>Helig lets out a bubbling hiss of frustration. "You sound just like him. No ambition, stuck on his pet project and his self-righteous sense of ethics."</DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>123</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Oh, no." Helig waves a half-rotted hand. "This is magic. And it took a great deal of... rather timely preparation, I must say." </DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>127</ID>
      <DefaultText>"If it were left to people like Moedred, animancy would be little more than sorting Engwithan pottery. We'd be as stuck in time as those hut-dwellers." He gestures at the table in front of him. "Everyone wants immortality, but nobody wants to know what it costs."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>128</ID>
      <DefaultText>A tremor passes through him. He clutches at his stomach. "Costs, indeed. There's a purpose yet that you can serve."</DefaultText>

      <ID>130</ID>
      <DefaultText>Helig's grooved brow furrows. "You what?" His hooked fingers claw through his beard. "The whole point was to make him suffer, you fool. Moedred may have robbed me of my life, but you've robbed me of my satisfaction."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He tugs a few hairs out of his beard. "If you can't fulfill my need for vengeance, then you'll have to serve another purpose." A dried and shriveled tongue darts over his cracked lips. "I'm afraid a fierce hunger was awakened along with me."</DefaultText>
