      <DefaultText>Maerwith watches you through kohl-rimmed eyes. She puts her hand on the hilt of her blade, jangling the jewels that hang from her wrist. "We don't know each other, stranger. Best we keep it that way."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"No." Her snarl flashes a gold tooth. "She turned me out. We were poorer than the fishermen who live there now, and when she learned I'd put food on our table with stolen coin, she told me that if she never saw me again, it'd be the mercy of the gods."

Her darkened eyes are filled with rage. "I had nowhere else to go. And it was a rough life until I rose to captain."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I'm a sailor." She gives you a half-smile. "And a... liberator of certain goods." Maerwith casually fingers a large earring. "And the nice thing about the snobs here is that they're usually too polite to ask more."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Maerwith raises an eyebrow. "What's it look like? Good wine and a little peace and quiet." She flips a copper coin with her thumb. "And Skerrion doesn't ask too many questions."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I didn't peg you for a liar. Least not from what I've heard." She looks you over, narrowing her eyes. "But that don't mean I believe you." She leans in, her voice a low hiss. "You'd better explain what gave you such an 'interesting' notion."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Heard you fancy yourself a comedian. If this is your idea of a joke, you'd better notice that I'm not laughing. No one goes near that old place." She leans in, her voice a low hiss. "I smell a setup."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Maerwith watches you through kohl-rimmed eyes. She puts her hand on the hilt of her blade, jangling the jewels that hang from her wrist. "I'm not looking for trouble. You can tell the Knights I'm just here for a drink."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She turns her eyes away. "She was always so stubborn. I forget sometimes where I got it." She gulps down the rest of her wine. "I'll go. Perhaps it will give both of us some peace."</DefaultText>
