      <DefaultText>In order to attend the animancy hearings at the palace, I'll need to be sponsored by one of the three main factions represented at the hearings: The Knights of the Crucible, House Doemenel, or The Dozens.

The Knights of the Crucible have a keep in First Fires.

House Doemenel has a manor in Brackenbury.

The Dozens are based out of the expedition hall in Copperlane.</DefaultText>
