      <DefaultText>Renengild told me I can find Galvino, an eccentric smith and animancer, east of Durgan's Battery. Uldric believes he may have something useful to tell me about the keep.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>According to Galvino, if I'm to enter Durgan's Battery, I'll need its cantec - a poem the dwarves would have used back when the keep was active. Unfortunately, anyone who would have known it is dead.

However, Galvino suggested that Stalwart may contain soul descendants of those dwarves - given my abilities, they won't be hard to find. I could learn the cantec by Awakening one of those souls. That may also doom someone to a fate like mine... or Maerwald's.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>I've found a direct soul descendant of someone from Durgan's Battery. I could Awaken this person now, or I could continue searching Stalwart for another candidate.

One way or another, I'll have to Awaken somebody who can tell me the cantec of Durgan's Battery. I should be able to Awaken an older soul by speaking directly to it. 

Easy enough, but it may have unpredictable consequences for the villager that soul lives in.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Galvino gave me a tool that might help. If I use it in the presence of villagers, it should specify anyone whose soul lineage is a few hundred years old. It's not perfect, but it should narrow my search.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Owynna, a maid at the Gr√©f's Rest, shares her soul with a dwarf named Gregur. He's corrupt and deceitful, so Awakening him could make things... interesting for the shy maid.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>I learned the cantec from Gregur, a crooked guard captain of Durgan's Battery whose soul lives in Owynna. The Awakening appears to be working a change on her already.

The verses of the cantec are:

"Hammers of Durgan, ring loud! May the anvil's deep music resound.

"Walls of the Battery safeguard our works from marauder and wilder alike.

"Abydon's faithful travail by the Forge and the fires that brighten the ore."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>I learned the cantec from Zenove, a dwarf who lived and died in Durgan's Battery. I was able to harness Zenove's intensity without overwhelming Taena. In fact, the old mine overseer appears to have found a new source of energy.

The verses of the cantec are:

"Hammers of Durgan, ring loud! May the anvil's deep music resound.

"Walls of the Battery safeguard our works from marauder and wilder alike.

      <DefaultText>The woman I needed to find was already dead, but I was able to learn the cantec from her lingering soul.
