      <DefaultText>"Something you need, sir?" She looks at the space between her feet.

But her posture changes, her chin rising and her shoulders rolling back, as Gregur takes over.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Who? I don't-"

Her face goes slack, and she looks for a second as if she's fallen asleep. 

But her eyelids flutter, and after several seconds, they open to slits.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You feel for Owynna's essence and almost instantly find yourself wrapped in darkness. It takes you a moment to realize that you've plunged into a very old memory.

But as your eyes adjust to the torchlight, you find yourself standing in a gloomy tunnel that you instinctively recognize as part of Durgan's Battery.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>A handful of figures in patchy cloaks and hoods - dwarves, like you - hunch over a mine cart. They're loading it with cloth-wrapped bundles from which you see the occasional flash of metal - the edge of a blade or the burnished glow of plate.

The other dwarves scurry with a curious mixture of haste and caution. They stack the bundles in a din of muted clangs and thumps, following the echoes of their ruckus down the tunnel with nervous eyes.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Pay attention! Sooner we get this done, the sooner we can go." Your voice is a dry whisper, and your nerves tingle with energy. You feel the same apprehension that the others do, but unlike them, you relish it.

Still, you look over your shoulder. Just in case.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Being captain of the guard doesn't pay much, but it does allow you to visit the armory without raising eyebrows. And with Coinmaster Zoltun selling off half of the Battery's arsenal, who's going to notice a few more missing pieces?

Besides, you've got a buyer lined up. As long as you can move these goods out of the Battery before someone squeals...</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>67</ID>
      <DefaultText>One of the men addresses you. "We're hurrying, Captain Gregur. Honest."

When you turn back, the others have redoubled their efforts, and you feel a pleasurable twist in your gut as they fill the cart.</DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>68</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Thief? I'm the captain of the guard. Best be careful where you sling an accusation like that."

Her words are slow and calculated.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I just want the cantec of Durgan's Battery."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>72</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Then you're not one of Zoltun's buyers, eh? Sounds to these ears like you want a deal."

She pauses, watching you for a reaction.</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>76</ID>
      <DefaultText>Her hand reaches for a weapon at her side - only then does she seem to realize that there's nothing there.

Something ripples across her face as the two consciousnesses - Gregur and Owynna - shift around one another, like two people squeezing through the same door.</DefaultText>

      <ID>77</ID>
      <DefaultText>Finally, she chuckles. "You have me at a loss. And yet... this is not a loss entirely." She looks herself over, holding out her arms and feeling the fabric of her clothing.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She smiles. "We're of one mind, then. However, I like to see offers on the table before I deal. What would you give me?"</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>86</ID>
      <DefaultText>She rolls her eyes. 

"Hammers of Durgan, ring loud! May the anvil's deep music resound.

"Walls of the Battery safeguard our works from marauder and wilder alike.

"Abydon's faithful travail by the Forge and the fires that brighten the ore."</DefaultText>

      <ID>87</ID>
      <DefaultText>"If anyone asks, you didn't hear it from me, got that? Now-"

Owynna doubles over, sneezing hard enough to scatter dust across the floor. She looks back up at you, wiping at her watering eyes.</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>93</ID>
      <DefaultText>"It's not all bad, Owynna. Way I see it, you and me could make some deals. To our mutual benefit."

She cranes her neck, taking in the dark room.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Gregur chuckles. "For you, not from you. I'm thinking it's time we got a raise."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>95</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I don't know about that. Haeferic's a bit of a miser, he is."

      <DefaultText>"Ondra's tides, I'm stuck with him."

Her body goes rigid, every muscle tensing. She stands there, frozen in shock, until a sly look warms her eyes. The thaw creeps down her shoulders and torso until at last she speaks again, her voice as smooth as oil.</DefaultText>
