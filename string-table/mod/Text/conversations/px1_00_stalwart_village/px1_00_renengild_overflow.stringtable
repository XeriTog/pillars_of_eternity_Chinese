      <DefaultText>Your awareness settles beneath Renengild's skin. You feel yourself looking through her eyes upon a time-faded memory.

You're standing in the inn. The room is stifling, but it's the body heat of so many furious villagers - not the neglected fire pit - that's drawn sweat from your pores.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Your husband waits by the door, about as far as he can get from the assembly. He holds Uldric, whose cheeks are bright as he watches the adults bicker with wide, fearful eyes.

You'd never realized how badly your neighbors stank, but something rank and repulsive rises from them as they pack together in this room.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"How much did the old snake pay you, Cyneheod?" It's Grynde, the head fisherman, jabbing a furious finger toward the back of the room. Cyneheod, your erstwhile mayor, squirms in a corner, pinned by the accusing stares of the entire village.

Oh, those eyes. They're cruel, porcine eyes, and they're watching Cyneheod with the dumb gluttony of hogs staring at fodder.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>4</ID>
      <DefaultText>The only sight that turns your stomach more is Cyneheod himself, trying to wriggle free of his own lies.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>5</ID>
      <DefaultText>A woman in the middle of the crowd waves her fist. "You thought you'd let a KILLER walk among us?" Cries of fierce agreement rise from the others. What began as a collective grumbling is swelling and congealing like stormclouds.

You look back at your husband. He's whispering to Uldric, but when you catch his eye, he directs a silent supplication to you.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>6</ID>
      <DefaultText>A wet smack draws your attention back to the other end of the room. Someone's thrown a potato, and Cyneheod cringes and rubs his jaw.

You want to shout at them all for this nonsense and waste, but you know this is about to get worse - Stalwart will have blood, and Galvino and his horror had the sense to flee already.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>7</ID>
      <DefaultText>You turn again, and your husband is beckoning you with swift, chopping motions. But what stops your breath is Uldric.

His little eyes are fixed on the churning mob, and you knew ever since you started hearing about those hideous purges that he'd see something like this one day, but did it have to be so soon? It's what drove that devil woman to madness, and now his little eyes have gotten big, big enough to swallow the whole scene, and now he's seeing you as a part of it.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>8</ID>
      <DefaultText>You want to leave now, but if you do, this is what your boy will remember - cowardice and madness. About people, about Stalwart. About you.

The people around you jostle and bark in their rage. They're dangerous animals, but animals nonetheless. They just need to be led.

So you push your way to the end of the room, where Cyneheod trembles in a puddle of his own piss.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>9</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Enough." Your voice boils up from your throat. The others fall silent, watching you.

They listen, dumbly trusting, as you turn Cyneheod's death sentence into an exile. No one contradicts you when you explain that he's going to march out of this village alone and into whatever miserable hamlet will have him. They silently agree when you explain that their hands are too clean for the likes of him.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>10</ID>
      <DefaultText>But there's something else forming behind their eyes - a kernel of trust and dependence. You feel it curdling around you, encasing you like a pearl does sand. 

You only wanted to spare Cyneheod's life, not volunteer for his job, but you see so much fear simmering just beneath their expressions - fear at god-men marching through the mountains, at Dyrwoodans and their purges, at dying the slow and lonely death of a ghost town.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>11</ID>
      <DefaultText>And you see their grateful reassurance mirrored in Uldric's expression. Perhaps this place is hopeless, but you realize that you can't leave it any more than you could leave your boy.

The only person who isn't looking at you is your husband. He's shaking his head, his eyes on the door.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"We've had smuggling problems out here for decades. Legitimate business dies out, and criminal rackets seize the roads like brambles."

The Devil of Caroc shoots Hiravias a glance, and he clamps his own mouth shut, covering it with a hand. 

He looks at Renengild and smiles innocently.</DefaultText>
