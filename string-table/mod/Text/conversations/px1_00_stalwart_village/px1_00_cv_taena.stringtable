      <DefaultText>You feel her essence humming and buzzing. Another personality and set of memories lies dormant within her soul, convulsing as if in fitful sleep.

The contours of that dormant soul are sharp. Ragged. As you reach out for it, it seizes you violently.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>A tremor passes through Taena's face, and then her rumpled skin goes slack. After a wracking cough, she blinks like someone slowly coming to consciousness.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You're standing in a darkened feasthall. Sturdy tables and benches have been stacked against the door in the far end of the room. 

You know it won't be enough.

A few dozen other dwarves from your tunneling crew wait with you, shovels and pickaxes in their shaking hands.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>23</ID>
      <DefaultText>One man turns to you. "Zenove, please. If we go now, we can get behind the barricade. We-we won't do any good here."

He's right, and you hear agreement in the quiet murmur of the others.

But Armswarden Marunn ordered you to hold your ground here.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>24</ID>
      <DefaultText>Yet in those rising whispers, you hear the opening bars of mutiny. You've never tolerated insubordination from your crew, and you aren't about to start.

So, you heft your pickaxe and swing it into the man's skull. He collapses, and the others fall silent. The acrid odor of urine rises from his body.</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>25</ID>
      <DefaultText>"We're gonna go down fighting. Anyone who feels differently can settle it with me right now." Your voice is hoarse from hours of shouting orders, but no one else moves. They cast their eyes down in the flickering torchlight.

Something thuds against the door. The others raise their weapons - picks, shovels, and a few swords - but they don't dare flinch. Your own pulse pounds at your temples.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>26</ID>
      <DefaultText>You pull back from Taena's soul, but you feel Zenove's wrath and ferocity tugging at you still. Her essence thrashes, lashing out at an unseen enemy.

Zenove is powerful, but dangerous, too. Her fury has anchored her to old and threatening memories.

You consider that there may be others you could Awaken.</DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>27</ID>
      <DefaultText>Taena, however, seems unaware of any of this, and she blinks back at you with cloudy, placid eyes.</DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>28</ID>
      <DefaultText>"What trickery is this, stranger? You think a Pargrun would so easily betray her own people?"

Her hands clench and unclench around an imaginary weapon. Zenove's essence stirs with the same battle-ready furor you sensed in her memory from Durgan's Battery. She is dangerous. 

Beneath Zenove, Taena's overwhelmed consciousness struggles.</DefaultText>

    <Entry>

      <DefaultText>She blinks. "Forgive me. I didn't recognize you."

Her fury abates, and confusion seeps into its place. You test its contours for purchase.</DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>37</ID>
      <DefaultText>Zenove's rage is a heavy fog that clots and thickens, choking Taena's fading consciousness.

Zenove herself is overwhelmed, and she forces Taena's eyes into narrow slits.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>38</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Then you're not one of Zoltun's visiting merchants or Exandru's foreign zealots. You're one of us."

Even as Zenove speaks through the old woman, you feel Taena's consciousness recover and steady itself.</DefaultText>

      <ID>43</ID>
      <DefaultText>Zenove at last overwhelms Taena, screaming through the old woman's mouth.

In that instant, Zenove's psyche expands, filling you with a lifetime's worth of memories and experiences, including a set of verses that you know to be the cantec of Durgan's Battery.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Taena is beginning to surface, but Zenove is stronger still, her rage and panic temporarily diminished.

    <Entry>
      <ID>56</ID>
      <DefaultText>Zenove is wresting full control from Taena - you feel the old woman's personality nearly smothered beneath Zenove's intensity.
