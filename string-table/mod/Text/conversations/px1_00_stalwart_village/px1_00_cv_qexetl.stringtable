      <DefaultText>A young man dressed in sturdy leathers glares at you. The creases in his face, tanned despite the scarce sunlight of the region, suffer a slight twitch as you approach him.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>As you step outside, the heavy wooden door of the temple slams shut behind you. You hear someone barring it from the other side. 

It sounds like the priests have engaged in an agitated conversation. You get the sense that they are discussing you, but you're also certain that the door is too thick to eavesdrop through - although there may be other places nearby where you'd stand a better chance.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>As you walk toward the frozen pond, a figure appears through the mist. Kneeling down next to a hole on the ice, the figure picks up a large chest and throws it into the water without hesitation.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The figure looks around. You glimpse a face you've seen before. Qexetl, one of Lafda's acolytes, pulls a hood over his head and throws a leather bag over his shoulder. 

Without looking back, he walks away in the direction of Stalwart Village.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I've got nothing for you. Speak with Lafda if you must." He turns away, his nose wrinkled.</DefaultText>
