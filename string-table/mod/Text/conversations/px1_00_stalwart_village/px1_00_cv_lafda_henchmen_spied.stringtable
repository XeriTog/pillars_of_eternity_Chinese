      <DefaultText>The wooden shutters of the temple's window, closed tight, muffle a set of voices coming from within the building. 

You can't quite make sense of the murmur, but cracking a shutter open would likely help.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>A rusty iron latch holds the window shutters closed. With care, you should be able to unfasten it without being noticed.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You carefully begin to lift the latch from its metal hook. Halfway there, the rusted iron resists with a screech. 

You freeze, listening to the voices in hopes the priests didn't hear. Their conversation continues uninterrupted.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You grab the latch and apply just the right amount of pressure, nudging the metal until its rust gives way without a sound. 

Carefully, you pull out the window shutters far enough to let the voices flow through.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You grab the latch and apply pressure, trying to push the metal past the block of rust that binds it to the shutter. The iron begins to groan. With a loud screech, it snaps free.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>After a moment, Lafda replies.

"Do you think I wanted this? That I could've known in advance?"

A pause ensues, its tension growing until the priestess' voice cuts it in half.

"We can't wait for him. We must fish out the last batch, quickly. After that, we'll decide."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The man responds in a broken voice, barely audible. You only distinguish the last words.

"... in that Russetwood pond... I'll go."

Their exchange seems to end. Cautiously, you step away from the window of Ondra's temple.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You place your ear against the coarse wood. Muffled voices rise and fall inside the temple. 

It's much too difficult to clearly make out what they say, but you think that something might be learned if you keep at it.</DefaultText>
