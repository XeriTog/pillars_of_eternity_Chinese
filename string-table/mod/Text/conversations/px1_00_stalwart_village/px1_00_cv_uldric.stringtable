      <DefaultText>"I sure hope you were right about killing Beregan. Because when you leave us for milder lands, it's us her kin'll come after." He folds his eyes and looks at you with tired, doubting eyes.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"You did right in parleying with Beregan. Dunno that anyone else here's gonna see it that way, but I thought you should know." He gives you a thoughtful nod before turning back to the fire.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He shrugs. "Mother's convinced that a magic forge will turn this frozen crack into a hub of civilization. She can't accept this place is dying."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You reach for Uldric's essence and find yourself staring at a fence post lying in a filthy slush of frozen mud.

Snow gathers around your legs and trickles into your boots. A wind nips at you even through layers of furs.

You hold a wood chisel in one numb hand and a mallet in the other. Kneeling over the fence post, you get to work.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"'Bout the only thing folk here haven't tried. Killing one more matron won't change things for long." He shakes his head.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Hour after hour, you hammer away, feeling the tools grow heavy in your grip as your breath fogs your vision. You want to do better work than this. You can do better work than this.

But no one's building new houses in Stalwart. The last table you crafted was put into the fishery, and pike entrails now trace the fine dovetail joints you so lovingly carved. 

Now, you mend the stockade, because that's what's needed.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The chisel slips, skidding alongside your hand.

You gasp. But you hold up your hand and see - much to your relief - all five fingers wiggling back at you.

You need to get out of this town.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You pull back from Uldric's soul. He's still staring into the fire, seemingly lost in his own memories, too.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"It's a fool's hope. A fantasy that's kept these parts inhabited longer than they should be." He glances around the old house and its worn furnishings.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"And then, one day, they locked their doors and died." He shrugs, turning his palms toward you.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"But that don't stop 'em from whispering a prayer when they pass the old fortress." A sour smirk crosses his lips.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"They're cut from the same cloth, Uldric. Only a matter of time before Beregan marches through that gap in our walls."

At the sound of Renengild's voice, Uldric's shoulders stiffen. His jaw works in a silent but furious retort.</DefaultText>
