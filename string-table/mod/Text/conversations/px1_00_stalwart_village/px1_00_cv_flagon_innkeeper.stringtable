      <DefaultText>You see a room, dark and damp - a cellar. It looks like part of the inn rather than an old fortress. Through Haeferic's eyes, you admires rows of gleaming bottles, recently dusted and polished.

As you step back from the shelves, you look on with satisfaction at a pressure plate concealed in the stone floor.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Don't hurt him or anything - I just want him to leave peacefully. Given your history, I thought I'd be clear on that point."

He gives you a meaningful look.</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>72</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I'd appreciate it. And I s'pose I don't need to remind you that I don't want you to hurt him. I'm sure you can find a more... discreet way of handling the problem."

      <DefaultText>"Yeah, yeah." Haeferic waves a hand dismissively. "I bet he's bawling. Look, I dabble in chemicals, but it's never something I can't fix. He's only a few ingredients from a cure."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"You want to help him out, all you need is a river reed and the heart of an ice troll. You ought to find both by water. That creek out west, for instance."</DefaultText>

      <ID>83</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Glad you think so." Haeferic chuckles. "Look, I dabble in the occasional potion, but I never whip up anything I can't cure. He gets desperate enough, I'm sure he'll find someone to fetch him the ingredients."</DefaultText>
