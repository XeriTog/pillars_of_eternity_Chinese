      <ID>2</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Not to be rude, but I'm rather busy. Can't you get another room?"

The orlan turns and glances past you with a quick, nervous motion. His ears, shredded and scalloped at the edges, are pressed against his skull.</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>3</ID>
      <DefaultText>"If this is about the room, I've already paid Haeferic. And I told him I wanted to be left alone."

He speaks carefully, as if afraid to give offense.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"He... what? Oh no. No."

He runs his claws through his hair and tugs at his long, ragged ears.</DefaultText>

      <ID>7</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Is she there? Did you find Defala?" Ailef shifts, caught between hope and terror.</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>20</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I wish it had gone differently. But I'd do it again. Anything to keep from getting sent back to that place."

He looks at you again, backing away.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>21</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I just wanted to hear your side of things. I still mean to deal with Defala."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>[Lie] "Calm down. I killed Defala anyway. You can go."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>24</ID>
      <DefaultText>"And thank you most of all. Here, take this. And tell Haeferic that he can keep the rest of the week's fee. I'm off."</DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>25</ID>

    <Entry>
      <ID>26</ID>
      <DefaultText>"It's not a yoke around my neck. And I suppose it's better than dying in this frozen crater of a town."

He musters the last of his dignity and prepares for the long march to Caed Nua.</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>27</ID>
      <DefaultText>He slowly relaxes. "Fair enough. Now that you've heard it, don't let them take me back there."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Ah. I'll wait here, then." He looks around the room, anxious and uncertain.</DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>31</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Liar! Monster! I trusted you! How could-"

He falls silent as one of the slavers cuffs him in the side of the head.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>32</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Haeferic sent me to check on you. He dislikes orlans, so of course he thinks you're up to something."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He bares his teeth. "Never. I'll die before I go back."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Have you... taken care of Defala? She won't give up now that she knows I'm here."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>39</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Is she there? Did you see her?"

He leans around you, peering at the doorway.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Defala! That woman. The slaver. She..."

He swallows.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>44</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I was a slave in Readceras. I ran away. Made it here. The mountains are usually the best place to lose slavers, but Defala's one of the best."

His hands tremble as he picks at his worn tunic.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>45</ID>
      <DefaultText>"That's terrible! There must be something we can do."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>46</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I'm so sorry. Can I help?"</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>47</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Perhaps we should tell someone. Stalwart wouldn't stand for this."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>48</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Slavery may be illegal here, but I wouldn't be the first runaway to get nabbed in a town like this while some local trapper gets a nice payday."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>49</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Besides, you spoke with Haeferic. I've kept to myself and paid on time, and he assumes the worst."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>50</ID>
      <DefaultText>"It's got to be Defala - she's been after me since the foothills. I'll pay you if you can get rid of her. I don't care how."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>51</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Not my problem."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>52</ID>
      <DefaultText>He winces. "Of course. Then please, keep my secret to yourself."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>53</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Thank you. But be careful. She wouldn't have come alone."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>54</ID>
      <DefaultText>"She wouldn't have followed me all the way here just to turn around and go home. No, she's waiting for me to leave."

He thinks, scratching his head with a claw-tipped finger.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>55</ID>
      <DefaultText>"A group of woodcutters stopped in the other day, said they'd passed a group of Readcerans west of town. Near a frozen pond, I think."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>56</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I'll wait until you tell me it's safe to go. Please, don't tell her where I am."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>57</ID>
      <DefaultText>Relief brightens his expression. "Thank the gods. Every last one of them. I never thought I'd see this day."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He slowly relaxes. "Sorry. I've been on the run too long. But thank you for your help."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>61</ID>
      <DefaultText>His pupils narrow to slits. "And I thought you were going to get rid of Defala, not sell me out to her."

He takes a deep breath, but his eyes are still focused on you.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>62</ID>
      <DefaultText>"What she said is true. I had a gambling problem when I was younger. I've paid seven years of my life for it - I won't pay any more."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>63</ID>
      <DefaultText>"As for the boy... I didn't want to hurt him. But he saw me as I was sneaking out of the stockade."

His shoulders go limp and his gaze distant at the memory. He shakes his head.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>64</ID>
      <DefaultText>Ailef hunches like a cornered animal, baring his teeth in a grimace. His eyes dart around the dingy room and back to you.

Finally, he straightens and sighs.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>65</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Maybe I'll turn you in."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>66</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Please, no!" He falls to his knees, clutching at the edge of your garment.</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>67</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I- I can pay you! I've scraped together a little money. It's yours if you get rid of her."</DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>68</ID>
      <DefaultText>"She's west of town. That's the rumor. Please, just help me get out of here." He looks down and wrings his hands.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />

    <Entry>
      <ID>69</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Quit babbling and tell me what you want."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>70</ID>
      <DefaultText>"But the locals talk about a Readceran party camped west of town." He worries at a ragged shirtsleeve.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />

    <Entry>
      <ID>71</ID>
      <DefaultText>"This one hides something. His mind is a maze of fear."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>72</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Can't imagine why he'd think a thing like that."</DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>74</ID>
      <DefaultText>"New Heomar? That's hardly an improv-" He stops himself, eyes wide.

"I mean, it's lovely. You'll love it."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Zahua's face darkens. "As long as slavers haunt his steps, there can be no freedom for his spirit."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>79</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I do not see the wisdom in this. Yes, his suffering is breathtaking, but surely he has earned his freedom.

"The suffering of a slave becomes suffering of a different sort once they escape, but it is no less moving to the soul." Zahua rubs at his wrists absently.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />

      <DefaultText>He draws back at your tone, cowering.

His eyes widen, and he looks past you.</DefaultText>
