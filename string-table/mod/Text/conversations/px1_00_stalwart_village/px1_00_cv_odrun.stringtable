    <Entry>
      <ID>51</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I'd be surprised if they return it willingly. They believe it's a sacred duty, to cast the offerings to the goddess in some place where they'll be forgotten. Better to find where they drop them, I think."</DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>76</ID>
      <DefaultText>He pushes himself up, wobbling, and starts to walk away with uncertain strides. After a few steps, he drops his hands and glances back. "Forget what you've seen of me. Okrun, High Walker of Marrat, was never here... just a memory to leave behind. Ondra will see to that."</DefaultText>
