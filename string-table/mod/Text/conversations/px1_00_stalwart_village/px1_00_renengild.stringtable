      <DefaultText>"We're an old mining town. Or we were until the Aedyrans pulled out and left us with a half-dug mineshaft and something resembling an inn." She thumps the sturdy, wooden wall with her fist.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Her upper lip curls into a snarl. "If we didn't need your help so badly, I'd send you packing.

      <ID>17</ID>
      <DefaultText>"But Durgan steel could put Stalwart on the map again - open up the mines, bring in new business. We just need the White Forge." She thumps the desk with her fist.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"And he butters his bread on both sides and fits his left shoe before his right, but that's neither here nor there!" She crosses her arms and crumples the page in one tightening fist.</DefaultText>

      <ID>41</ID>
      <DefaultText>Her laughter is a quick, angry bark. "He wore out his welcome in Stalwart. He's better off with ogres and lagufaeth as his neighbors now."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"'Minding their own business.' Never mind the latest expedition's disappearance. Or the broken stockade." She pinches the bridge of her nose, squinting.</DefaultText>

      <ID>48</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I'm saying we shouldn't agitate 'em further." He makes to toss another slice of peel into the fire, but he fumbles and drops his knife. He bends to pick it up, cursing.</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>54</ID>
      <DefaultText>"That brawl outside was just the latest patch of trouble. The ogre clans are getting bolder, and we'll all sleep easier knowing they aren't circling our walls."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>55</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Also, Beregan's like to have whatever the last expedition found. Rumor has it they disappeared near her turf."

      <DefaultText>She frowns. "I'll appeal to your coin purse rather than your sense of charity. Matron Beregan's bound to have plenty of hoarded gear and money. It's yours if you get rid of her."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Good. Before you leave town, stop by the Gréf's Rest. Most visitors to Stalwart spend some time there, so Haeferic and his patrons may be able to give you the lay of the land."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Before you go - trappers haven't seen Beregan's ogres for a spell. I hear we've got you to thank for that. Whole village is resting easier." She takes a deep breath, and you notice that the dark circles under her eyes have faded.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"But the White Forge... Well. If we could fire it up again and start producing Durgan steel - or something close to it - wouldn't matter if we're in the White March or the Living Lands. Business would come." She folds her arms and gives you a stiff nod.</DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>105</ID>

      <FemaleText />

    <Entry>
      <ID>110</ID>
      <DefaultText>"But the place has a funny way of sealing itself up. Front door stays shut, the tower entrances are clogged with rubble, and it's been impossible to blast a way in."

    <Entry>
      <ID>111</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Because you can shave stone with it. Cleave cast iron in two. And the stuff's as rare as it is remarkable."

      <DefaultText>"Enough. They're gone." She holds up a hand, which is missing the final joint of the ring finger. But it's her voice, sharp and steely, that silences the young man.

As he glowers at his toes, she turns to you with dark circles under her eyes and a smile pulled taut across her thin lips.</DefaultText>
