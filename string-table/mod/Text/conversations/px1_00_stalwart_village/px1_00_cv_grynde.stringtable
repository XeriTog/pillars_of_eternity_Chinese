      <DefaultText>"It may stink of fish guts, but there's no place more critical to Stalwart's survival." He nods, a blush of pride rising above his beard.</DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>11</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Just about everything. I track the day's catches and see that our nets and hooks are in working order."

He crosses his arms over his broad chest, throwing his shoulders back.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Bet he did. He despised Stalwart when he lived among us and all the more when we gave him the boot. 

"Never knew the old man to stay silent, that's for sure."

He wrinkles his nose, scowling at some old memory.</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>20</ID>
      <DefaultText>The fishery door creaks open, and in walks Grynde, staring at you - and the bracelet - in surprise and outrage.

His face drains of color.</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>24</ID>
      <DefaultText>"And rummaging through the fishery's private supplies under the cover of night? I think not."

Even as he speaks to you, his eyes are fixed on the bracelet. A flush rises in his face.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>25</ID>
      <DefaultText>His face flushes crimson. "Any who'd put stock in the ravings of that bitter old fool deserve all trouble they get." He raises his voice, half-turning to the guard with him.</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>28</ID>
      <DefaultText>"It was an accident. I was a failure and a wretch then, but I never would have killed anyone. Least of all my own kin."

He turns his gaze down, offering his apology to his own clenched fists.</DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>29</ID>
      <DefaultText>He opens his mouth to reply, but the words catch in his throat. The guard next to him stares at the bracelet, recognition turning to horror.</DefaultText>

      <ID>33</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Let me do the work Arda would've done. That's my debt to Stalwart and the only fitting way to honor my sister." He looks up at you, his eyes bright and clear.</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>34</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Thank you. Stalwart may not know what you've done for them tonight, but they'll hear of your honor."</DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>35</ID>
      <DefaultText>He sighs heavily. "Kept thinking I could get by this way, but I guess you're right. It's time they knew the truth about me."

He turns to leave, looking back at the fishery one last time.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>As you reach for Grynde's essence, you find yourself wrapped in the cold embrace of a snowstorm.

You trudge through the snow, each step laborious to your numb feet. You keep your head down against the wind, and your back is bent under a heavy burden.

Ahead of you is the frozen lake and the hole you made in it.</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>43</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Anyway, excuse the mess. If there's something you need, the clerk can get you sorted."

He raises a graying eyebrow at a man sorting various stocks and supplies near the back of the room.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"My family's been in charge of the fishery since the early days of Stalwart. I know the best spots to find frostdiver and irontooth pike, and I make sure we don't overfish the speckleback."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>46</ID>
      <DefaultText>"But try telling these folk as much. We go home each day covered to the elbows in fish oil and entrails, reeking of our work."

His eyes soften with the gaze of a stern but loving father.</DefaultText>

    <Entry>

      <DefaultText>"Stalwart's shrinking, but it would disappear if we lost the fishers. I drive 'em hard, but I can't afford to do otherwise."</DefaultText>

His gaze grows distant, and he scratches at his salt-and-pepper beard.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Your feet crunch over the ice. You wait - and secretly hope - for the telltale crack beneath you. With the village distant and dark behind you, you would sink and none would know. At least that would free you of the heavy, churning feeling in your gut.

Yet you reach the hole, and the ice is still steady under you.</DefaultText>

      <ID>70</ID>
      <DefaultText>You heft the burden off of your shoulders, cradling it - cradling her - in your arms. She's wrapped in nets and weighted with stones. 

You wish one of the priests of Ondra were here with solemn words and the assurance of ceremony. 

Instead, you slip a bracelet off of her wrist. Ondra will have her body, and you will carry this reminder.</DefaultText>
