      <DefaultText>"Thought I'd found shelter when I stumbled across this little village. Guessing you did, too, eh?" 

Feara raises a frosty mug to you. Even though the warmth of the hearth reaches you here, her hands are wrapped in wyr wool and her ears muffled by a hat. Her face has the taut, wind-beaten look of someone who's recently come from the road.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"As much blood as there was in the streets, I'm lucky the ale's still flowing."

She takes a drink, and as she tilts her head back, you see a bruise purpling her jaw and the crimson bloom of scraped knuckles.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I was part of an expedition. Hunting for relics from Durgan's Battery. We'd picked up a good haul, too."

She takes a slow swallow of her beer.</DefaultText>

      <ID>21</ID>
      <DefaultText>She blinks. "Well... sure. You've proven yourself capable. Take Lynam and Francesca's shares. I'll be sure to tell the boss about you."

She gives you a slow grin.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>22</ID>
      <DefaultText>Her mouth hangs open. "You- fine. Guess I'm stuck here, because I don't dare face my supplier empty-handed.

"Hope you're happy." She gulps the rest of her drink.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>23</ID>
      <DefaultText>"All right, all right. Here, I'll take the svef and you can have Lynam and Francesca's shares.

"I just want to get out of here without any trouble, okay?"</DefaultText>

      <ID>30</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Watch yourself if you're heading out to the Battery. There's more than ogres to worry about."

      <DefaultText>In front of you, Feara's swaddled hands work quickly to bundle and tie a parcel. With you are a man and another woman, both similarly occupied.

The three of you stand in a small hut. It's nearly bare but for the rickety table before you and three cheap cots piled with furs.

The man hefts his parcel like something rare and precious.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>37</ID>
      <DefaultText>"That's the last of them. Check the rest of the supplies while I load these." He disappears through a door and into a howling gale. The door swings shut with a loud clap.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>38</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Not much choice. Snows have covered most of the other passes. This one gets just enough traffic to stay open." You feel the answer ring out of your own throat. 

The thought doesn't bring either of you much comfort. You don't mention the real issue, which is that Lynam's made up his mind.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>39</ID>
      <DefaultText>Feara stands in front of you, distracted with the contents of her mug. She doesn't seem to have noticed your momentary lapse.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>40</ID>
      <DefaultText>Francesca stares at you for several seconds, apparently thinking the same thing. You can't see her expression clearly enough to tell whether she's resigned or preparing an argument.

She shoves out the door without another word.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>41</ID>
      <DefaultText>"So it figures that's when the winds pick up and the sky starts dumping snow. We lost sight of the road.

"Meanwhile, something else found us."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>42</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Took Lynam out before we even realized we were surrounded. And then we see 'em coming out of the snow - these little four-armed wilder. Lagufaeth, they're called."

She shakes her head, staring at the embers in the fire pit.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>43</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Quick little bastards. Francesca and I held 'em off as long as we could, but when they filled her full of darts, I turned tail and ran."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>44</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Found my way here and thanked my luck for escaping the lagufaeth. Then come to find out that this town's got an ogre problem."

She laughs bitterly.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>45</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I need to get those artifacts. Not that I'm in any shape to go after them myself. But I can't afford to return to Defiance Bay without something to show for my expedition."

Apprehension creeps into her expression. She stares into her mug, swirling its contents.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />

    <Entry>
      <ID>50</ID>
      <DefaultText>"But you might be able to get past the lagufaeth. You're light on your feet."

She looks up from her mug, hopeful.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>51</ID>
      <DefaultText>"But you know how to navigate the wilds. You'd be able to find your way out there and back with no trouble, I'd wager."

She looks up from her mug, hopeful.</DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>52</ID>
      <DefaultText>"You're in the merchant business. You know what it means to lose a month's worth of goods."

      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>53</ID>
      <DefaultText>"But you've got your own expedition to the Battery, don't you? While you're out there, maybe you could look for my goods. Whatever's left of them."

She looks up from her mug, hopeful.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>54</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I'll give you a cut for anything you bring back, of course. I ain't asking for charity. I just can't afford to go home empty-handed."

She brushes her nails along the side of her mug as that anxious look returns.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Look, I'm sorry if I didn't give you the whole story. But surely you can appreciate why I wouldn't announce my business like that."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>59</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Look, you seem forthright. But I couldn't just announce my business, could I? Even you've got to understand that."</DefaultText>

      <ID>60</ID>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>61</ID>
      <DefaultText>She cocks an eyebrow. "To be honest, I didn't think you'd really want to know. Seemed more tactful to leave out the messy details."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>62</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Look, I'm just trying to get by. You may not agree with my business, but have some pity. If I don't deliver this shipment, my supplier will have it in for me."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>63</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I understand. Just watch your step if you find yourself near the Battery. Those lagufaeth can't be far."</DefaultText>

      <ID>64</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I'd sure appreciate it. Bring back whatever you can find, and I'll see to it that you're compensated."</DefaultText>

      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>70</ID>
      <DefaultText>"No, that would've been somebody else. We didn't meet with Renengild - or anyone else in town, for that matter. We were operating on our own."

She looks into the fire pit, taking another drink.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>71</ID>
      <DefaultText>"We took out several loans to pay for our trip out here. I'm gonna have trouble if I don't pay them back." She scratches the back of her neck.</DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>72</ID>
      <DefaultText>"What's left of it should be near Durgan's Battery. If you stumble across the lagufaeth, you'll know you're close."</DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>73</ID>

      <DefaultText>She nods. "That's a kind sentiment. I'll mourn them when I get home. But I've got to retrieve our haul if I'm to have any hope of that."</DefaultText>
