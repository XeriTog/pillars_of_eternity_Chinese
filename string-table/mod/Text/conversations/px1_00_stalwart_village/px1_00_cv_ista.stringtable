      <DefaultText>"Oh! Oh, it's working! Yes! I can't believe it, it's really - Oh." The dwarven woman looks at you, a disappointed expression on her face. In her hands is a large, rectangular box, covered in strange dials and symbols.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I'm sorry. I didn't mean to be so rude - I'm Ista. I heard we have you to thank for clearing out the ogres. I'm glad Stalwart survived. It would have been a disappointing trip up here, otherwise."</DefaultText>

      <ID>23</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Centuries ago, dwarves carrying tools just like this one followed their readings to what is now the Battery. If I can recreate their work, then I may be able to find ore deposits elsewhere."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>28</ID>
      <DefaultText>"It's actually quite sophisticated, if you'll forgive me a little professional pride. A mix of alchemical processes and scrying enchantments. And some very expensive crystals."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I have to study this further - But all the same, it worked! At last, a breakthrough! With that adra to work from, I can refine the enchantments - we'll be digging up iron, gold, adra, all of it!"</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>45</ID>
      <DefaultText>"What? But that's - that's all the evidence I have. It'll take months to re-attune the device. Longer, if I have nothing to go off of!"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"No, it's more likely that the device doesn't work. I must have made a mistake somewhere. I'll have to start from the beginning."</DefaultText>
