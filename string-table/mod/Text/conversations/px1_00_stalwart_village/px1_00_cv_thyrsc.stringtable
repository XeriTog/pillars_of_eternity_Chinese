      <DefaultText>"You have my respect. That fortress has been haunting us for ages. A shared dream nobody could get their hands on.

      <DefaultText>"Didn't have a speck of hope you'd get the Battery open, but you've gone and done it. Best shot this town has had in years.

But without Renengild we're just treading water. Don't see anyone taking up the mantle of mayor anytime soon."</DefaultText>
