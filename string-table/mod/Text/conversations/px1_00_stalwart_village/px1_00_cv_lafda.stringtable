      <DefaultText>She stiffens her back. "A benevolent spirit. We won't wait for your mood to change." 

Her accomplices put their weapons away and begin to gather their belongings. 

Lafda points to a large chest in the room. "Qexetl brought back the dwarf's heirlooms, but consider them a parting gift."</DefaultText>
