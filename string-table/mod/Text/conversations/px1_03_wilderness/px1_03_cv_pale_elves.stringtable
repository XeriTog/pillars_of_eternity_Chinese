      <DefaultText>"Hey, Vamrel..."

One of the elves has turned to look at you, motioning at the man occupied with the ogre.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The elves turn to look at you, hands falling to their weapons. Vamrel gives a final sharp yank on the rope before he turns as well.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>A group of elves stands in a scattered ring around an ogre. But they do not appear to be engaged in battle.

The ogre is bound with rope, and one of the elves tugs harshly on the line tied around the ogre's neck.</DefaultText>

      <ID>9</ID>
      <DefaultText>The ogre only snorts angrily and pulls back on the rope. 

Two other elves prod him somewhat timidly with their poleaxes. The ogre does not budge.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Before anyone can speak another word, you have nocked and loosed an arrow. 

It flies true, striking the rope between the ogre's neck and hands, and the bindings give with a snap.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Another elf whispers something in Vamrel's ear.

Vamrel's eyes brighten.

"Ah, not so fast. Here, beast- let's see what you can do!"</DefaultText>

      <ID>16</ID>
      <DefaultText>You stride forward purposefully, and knock the elf flat with one solid blow to the jaw. 

The other elves turn, startled.</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>17</ID>
      <DefaultText>You aim a solid punch at the elf's face, but the blow only sends her stumbling a few steps backwards.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>As they heft their weapons, the bound ogre takes advantage of the commotion, and hauls backward, tearing the rope free of his captor's hands. 

With a triumphant roar, the ogre pulls apart the bindings on his arms.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The ogre gives a great bellow, and suddenly lunges backward, tearing the rope free of his captor's hands. 

With a triumphant roar, the ogre pulls apart the bindings on his arms.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Oh, we'll be further from it still tomorrow. Just picking up some help along the way."

      <DefaultText>"A kind offer, but we have it under control. The beast came along meekly enough before- I'll have it so again shortly."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>27</ID>
      <DefaultText>You aim a solid punch at the elf's face, but there is little strength behind the blow. The elf is more startled than hurt, and she recovers quickly.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>With a triumphant roar, the ogre pulls the rest of his fetters away, and lunges toward his captors.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"He came cheap. We need the muscle- gods know they're good for little else." Vamrel gives the rope another tug.

The ogre's already impressive scowl deepens.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I purchased him from some slave-hunters, not far from here. Looking to recoup their expenses, I expect." 

He grunts. "Not sure he's worth quite so much coin."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"As are you, stranger. Were you feeling homesick for colder climes?" 

Vamrel chuckles. "We'll be further along still tomorrow. Just picking up some help along the way."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"It's the elves who should be ashamed. This is slavery, I don't care if it's a violent monster!"

Hiravias balls his fists.</DefaultText>
