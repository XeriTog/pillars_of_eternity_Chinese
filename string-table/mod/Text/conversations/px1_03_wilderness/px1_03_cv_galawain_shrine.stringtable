      <DefaultText>This simple shrine is covered in a thick layer of snow, fallen leaves and feathers. A pair of curving bones flanks the altar.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The shrine does not appear to be frequented very often, though traces of old candle wax line the edges of the stone. 

Under a dusting of frost, you note a rectangular section of the altar's surface that seems to be cleaner than the rest - as if something once rested here.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The altar does not appear to have been touched since your last visit. Wind whistles softly past the arcing bones.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>As you set the totem back down onto the shrine, the wind suddenly picks up, lifting powdery snow and leaves into the air. 

You hear the distant baying of hounds upon the breeze, and the air grows thick with the scent and taste of copper and gunpowder.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The bear carving's eyes seem to gleam, pinpoints of crimson against a sudden, growing darkness. 

Lean shadows prowl against the backdrop of the stone altar, and for one timeless moment you feel as if you are being pulled away by a current of fear and ferocity, the thrill of chasing and the panic of  being pursued.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>For a moment, the bear carving's eyes seem to gleam - only to fade, like a dying fire. Soon enough the shrine is still and silent once more.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You feel a tingle run up your arm as you set your fingers to the altar. In the instants after, the wind seems to die down, the sounds of the wilderness growing muted to your hearing.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Then, you hear a sudden, low growl, quickly joined by more. A vision strikes you like a sudden memory, though it is unbound by time or place. 

Within a sea of darkness, you see a great beast, formless save for its gleaming fangs.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>It growls and snaps with increasing desperation and savagery, and for a moment you feel its rage as your own - a possessive fury that tears at you. 

Something has been taken, your territory threatened, and the price for it will be blood...</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The vision fades just as swiftly as it came. The altar stands silent and still, and the air fills again with the occasional trill of birdsong.</DefaultText>
