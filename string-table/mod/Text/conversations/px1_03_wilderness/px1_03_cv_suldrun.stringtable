      <DefaultText>Standing tall amongst the wolves inhabiting the cavern, this creature turns to face you as you venture forward. Scores of wounds and scars riddle its hide, and one dull eye stares out blindly from its skull. It growls a threat as you approach - one echoed by its fellows.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>As the beast turns its head back towards the hunter, you sense a strange aura emanating from it. 

It is as if its hide were holding in a tempest of soul essence, fierce and all-consuming as flame.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The creature snaps and snarls, evidently uncomprehending. It edges toward the nearest hunter, even as it watches you balefully with its single eye.</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>33</ID>
      <DefaultText>You fling a torch at the beast, and it gives a sharp yelp as the torch bounces off its hide with a burst of embers. 

The beast leaps away from the hunters, stumbling in its panic. But the wolves surge forward, snarling.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>It takes little effort, before the beast's soul threatens to overwhelm you with its intensity. 

Wrath and hunger buffet you on all sides, until you reach through the storm to find a smaller, dimmer pulse of light - and are swept headlong into a memory...</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>35</ID>
      <DefaultText>The memory slips from you, and when you come back to yourself the beast is shaking its head as if to clear an itch, clawing at its ears.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>This young man nearly vanishes within his tattered furs. Both man and hide are covered in patches of grime and dried blood. 

His head snaps up immediately as you enter, and you find yourself on the receiving end of a  fearful, one-eyed gaze.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Galawain- The totem! I took it to gift to father, and then the ogre attacked. I changed- and it was like I was shackled to someone else. He wanted to chase, to hunt, forever."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>51</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I remember it in pieces. It's mostly darkness, but I could see, sometimes. I think I hurt someone. Wait - my father! Thyrsc- is he alive? Where is he?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The chill bites into your cheeks, and your lungs burn a little from the run. You look down at the little wooden carving in your hand, and run your thumb along the edge of the carved bear's spine.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Suldrun." Your father's voice snaps you out of your reflections, and you rush forward to rejoin him beside the campfire. 

You brandish the hares, and catch a glimpse of a rare smile under his graying beard.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>55</ID>
      <DefaultText>But the smile disappears almost immediately, as a shadow falls over you both. 

You feel the rush of wind a moment before the log comes crashing down, and roll out of the way just in time. You hear your father cry out in pain, somewhere nearby. Both the hares and the totem slip from your grasp.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />

    <Entry>
      <ID>56</ID>
      <DefaultText>The totem has already brought you luck. You've found two rabbits in as many snares, and that's a rare enough feat these days. 

You're certain now that this was a gift from Galawain - that you were meant to find it on that lonely shrine, and take it.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You can feel power surging within you. Your heart thunders in your chest, but instinct pulls your senses into order, and you feel the familiar stretch of limbs, the sudden, dizzying shift in height. 

But something is wrong.</DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>58</ID>
      <DefaultText>Your senses are fading, rather than growing stronger. There's a howling in your head, like a screaming chorus, and everything in you shrieks for you to bite, to tear, to eat...</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Zahua slaps Suldrun hard across the face. Suldrun looks at him with wide eyes, dumbstruck.

Zahua shrugs. "Usually works for me." 

He looks around at everyone. "What?"

Suldrun seems to shake off the hit.</DefaultText>
