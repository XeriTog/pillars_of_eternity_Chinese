      <DefaultText>A few odds and ends lie scattered by the path. There appears to have been a struggle here, but the evidence is half-buried under a thin blanket of snow.

Wisps of essence hover in the chilly air.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>An empty pack lies in the snow. It's been rent by knives. Or claws.

Also, muddy tracks churn the ground. They're three-toed and webbed, and you count over a dozen separate pairs, all leading north.

They look recent.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>An empty pack lies in the snow. It's been torn nearly in two.

Also, muddy tracks churn the ground. It's difficult to discern their shape or number, but they appear to lead north.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Your name is Ygadr. You've never been more than twenty miles from home - let alone to the White March - and yet you've been climbing steadily higher for a week now.

The air is too thin, your clothes are too light, and you've barely got another three days' worth of food with you.

      <DefaultText>You've only had a handful of fainting spells since you began your journey - you've had as many in a single day before. 

But the dreams have been the best part. Despite the frozen, rocky ground and the screeching winds, sleep has found you each night and brought you visions of majestic peaks wrapped in snow. The cold is but a sweet ache in your bones.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>And as you hike into the wind, you feel that ache spreading along with the certainty that you're getting closer to him. Or her.

Your soul twin.

A stranger whose soul mirrors your own. One of the few people in Eora who could understand the constant torment of a split soul, and the only person who could help you relieve it.</DefaultText>

You feel a throbbing presence like a heartbeat through linen, and you know-</DefaultText>
