      <DefaultText>"Don't see many on these roads, and the few we do are hunters, woodcutters, or smugglers."

She cocks an eyebrow at you and gives you a half-smile. She holds herself with confident grace, a conspicuous holster slung over one hip.

Beyond her is a wagon loaded with supplies. Manacles dangle from one end.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I'm looking for a fugitive from Readceras. An indentured servant and a wanted criminal."

      <ID>21</ID>
      <DefaultText>"And I'm glad you do. So if you come across this fellow, I hope you'll send him my way. Just don't turn your back on him."

    <Entry>
      <ID>47</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Funny thing, but I could've sworn I told you to send Ailef back alive. Now I hear that you've made a mess of him in that poor dwarf's inn."

      <DefaultText>"Now, that distinction isn't much heeded in the Dyrwood. But as you may have noticed, we're barely in the Dyrwood."
