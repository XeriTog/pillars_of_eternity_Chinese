      <DefaultText>"How goes it." The elven man emerges into the clearing and freezes, staring at the Devil of Caroc. For an elf, he's tall and rangy, with a weather-beaten face beneath stringy, greasy hair.

The others with him turn, glaring and gaping at the bronze golem.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"It's a killer! Look, we don't want no trouble. Just trying to do our work."

Beads of sweat have formed on his forehead despite the chilly air.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"It's him. Harmke. I remember that weak chin and those knobbly knees."

She stops, staring motionless at the figures among the trees.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Enough! What do you see, [Player Name]? Is that the man who torched us?"

The Devil sways on her feet, her whole body moving around the axes of her ankles. Though she's talking to you, her attention, a concentrated spear of essence, is focused on Harmke.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>His expression falls. "Everyone does. Let the Readcerans into the Dyrwood. What's that got to do with anything?"</DefaultText>

      <ID>18</ID>
      <DefaultText>You see memories. Snow-shrouded forests partitioned by fallen pines and firs. Days measured by the steady swing of your axe.

There are other moments, too, recollections that flare up like a hearth's welcoming fire. There are children, spry and lanky like you, but still full of the rowdy energy of youth.

Together, you scatter winterbloom petals on a grave.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>19</ID>
      <DefaultText>You reach deeper into Harmke's soul.

Years roll back. A torch in your left hand bathes your face and shoulder in heat. All around you are other men and women holding other torches, and the mountain air is acrid with the stench of smoke and sweat.

Rage billows off of the others. It's been a fever in your blood for days now, exhausting you and invigorating you in equal measure.</DefaultText>

      <ID>20</ID>
      <DefaultText>You're at the edge of that town. Cold Morn. It's hours yet before dawn, but the commotion has started to awaken the village. Candlelight ignites behind frost-crusted windows, and haunted faces peer out at you through the glass.

You begin to doubt yourself.

Just then, a door slams. A villager comes racing through the streets, kicking up snow. With his stark white face and pale hair, he looks almost like a ghost.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />

    <Entry>
      <ID>21</ID>
      <DefaultText>The line of torchbearers ripples as he gets closer. He picks up speed, but nobody moves toward him. You imagine him breaking through the row, shattering your ranks like the bad dream that brought you all here.

You imagine waking up in your bed, the heat from your torch nothing more than the warmth of your wife sleeping next to you.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>22</ID>
      <DefaultText>Instead, the villager reaches the row of torchbearers a stone's throw away from you. A woman advances from the line and buries her dagger in his neck.

The rest of your fellows shout. Rage, memory, and bloodthirsty triumph boil up in you. You all came with a purpose. You came to bring justice to the traitors of Cold Morn.</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>23</ID>
      <DefaultText>The next few hours are painted in colors more vivid than life. You put your torch to anything that stands and your sword to anyone who runs. It is as if Magran herself whispers in your ear and guides your hand.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>24</ID>
      <DefaultText>Exhaustion has almost cooled your rage when you spy a house at the edge of town - one of the only buildings that hasn't already burned. It's flanked by knotty spruce trees, and the door is painted yellow. 

Yellow. The bloom of sunrise. The hue of your son's hair. 

The color of cowardice.</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>25</ID>
      <DefaultText>Just then, someone barrels into you from behind. It's a man - someone you remember from the journey to Cold Morn, though you can't recall his name. He snarls at you, mad with indiscriminate rage, and it occurs to you that he's mistaken you for one of the villagers. 

You smash the window and hurl your torch inside. The other man has turned away. You think you hear a child shriek within the house, but it's impossible to tell above the roar of the riot.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Harmke shivers as you pull away from his memory. His eyes are wide with guilt and fear.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"What a waste."

She watches as Harmke runs and stumbles away. As he disappears, she turns back, her joints rattling like empty pots and pans.</DefaultText>

      <ID>70</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Don't give me that greasy horseshit! You looked into the squalid dregs of his soul. Tell me what you saw."

She steps toward you, strangely clumsy. Heat patterns streak and flare across her body. The snow melts around her feet.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>71</ID>
      <DefaultText>She stares at Harmke. You hear only a whirring mechanism in her throat, but Harmke leans closer.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>72</ID>
      <DefaultText>"But I remember him! How can you be sure?" Her fists clang down onto her knees.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>73</ID>
      <DefaultText>A wild, inhuman scream echoes out of the bizarre machinery of her throat. It drops Harmke and his companions to their knees, where they cry out in terror.

Gears squeal and crank as she rushes at him.</DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>76</ID>
      <DefaultText>As she looks from Harmke back to you, a despairing groan rises out of her throat. Questions bubble and burst in her essence.

Finally, the heat patterns fade from her chest plate, and her body surrenders its tension.</DefaultText>
