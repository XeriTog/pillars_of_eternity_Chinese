      <DefaultText>Behind a frigid curtain of water is an alcove, its walls flecked with ice. In the middle you see a rough stone pedestal, also glazed with ice from the falls.

A cruciform hilt and a tapered blade protrude from the pedestal. Judging from the size of the hilt and the apparent length of the blade, you infer that it is an estoc.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The alcove and the stone pedestal are little more than dilapidated ruins. Ice pries cracks in the stone and coats the slick floor.

The estoc - what little of it you can see - appears to be in better condition. It seems odd that anyone would leave it here.

However, as you get close to it, you hear what sound like the screams and shouts of tormented souls.</DefaultText>
