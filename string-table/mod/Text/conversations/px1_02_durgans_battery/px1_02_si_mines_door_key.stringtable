      <DefaultText>As you approach the door, you notice a round depression within the surrounding frame. The molding around the depression is elaborately carved, with a row of foreign symbols lining the topmost edge of the circle.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>At first the disc does not seem to fit - until it is oriented a specific way. You hear a quiet click of casings as it sinks into place. Nothing appears to happen right away, however. 

On the disc itself, an arrow-shaped protrusion points north.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The depression is about three finger widths' deep, with a few small stone fragments jutting out from within the wall. Some pieces seem to rotate independently along slots, but they have no obvious effect in and of themselves.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The dial spins out of your hand. It makes a complete revolution and rises so that it's flush with the rings once more.

It comes to rest with the arrow pointing north.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You press the disc as the arrow points south.

You feel a satisfying thunk and notice that the dial has sunk a fraction of an inch into the depression.

The door is still locked, but this feels like a step in the right direction.</DefaultText>

After another small thud, the dial sinks a hair lower into the stone moulding. The change is almost too small to see, but it seems to indicate progress.</DefaultText>
