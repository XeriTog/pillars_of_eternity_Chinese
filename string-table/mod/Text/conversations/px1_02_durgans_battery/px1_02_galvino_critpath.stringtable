      <DefaultText>He erupts with a ragged cackle. "This one's got spirit!" Still wheezing with mirth, he turns to the bronze golem over his shoulder.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He laughs. "You would miss me if I were gone, aimora. For who would tolerate your barbs and insults?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Old men and women, too, seeking a final blaze of glory before they're snuffed out for another turn at the Wheel. Sound familiar?" His smile is rigid as he looks at you, and the corner of his eye twitches.</DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>26</ID>
      <DefaultText>"But the door of the keep - the one the Pargrunen filled with essence - it was made to listen. To recognize its masters."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>30</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Some liken it to a poem. Others to an anthem. In reality, it is more than either." He holds one hand out, turning it this way and that in a balancing motion.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>31</ID>
      <DefaultText>"A cantec is a statement of purpose. A declaration of identity. Each is unique to its stronghold."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>32</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Thus, to enter a fortress like Durgan's Battery, you would stand at the gate and recite its cantec."

He spreads his arms, his face aglow.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>33</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Very well. Where would I learn this cantec?"</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>34</ID>
      <DefaultText>"To learn the cantec, you must speak with one of the dwarves of Durgan's Battery! A shame they are all dead, no?" He rubs his hands together, pacing.</DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>35</ID>
      <DefaultText>"But no doubt their souls live on in one or two of the villagers of Stalwart. Like fine wine poured into a cheap pot." Derision curls his lips.</DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>36</ID>
      <DefaultText>He wags a finger at the ceiling. "But to identify them... that is the first problem. You would need the skills of an animancer."</DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>40</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Enough!" He snatches an inkpot from the desk and hurls it at the golem. It flies wide, spattering the wall with ink. Motionless, the golem watches him with her black glass eyes.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>41</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I shall speak no more of that damned village." Galvino's mouth and brows have calcified into a stern expression.</DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>43</ID>
      <DefaultText>The golem swivels her head sharply toward you. Her mask of a face, and the glass eyes behind it, betray no emotion, but it seems as if she's watching you carefully.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>44</ID>
      <DefaultText>"A Watcher? Di verus?

"If this is true, then you could find a soul descendant from Durgan's Battery, no question, but the greater difficulty remains."

Galvino rubs his gaunt, whiskered cheeks.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>45</ID>
      <DefaultText>"You would have to learn the cantec from the dormant soul. And to do that, you would have to Awaken it."</DefaultText>

      <ID>46</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Awaken someone? How would I do that?"</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>47</ID>
      <DefaultText>"An Awakening is merely the jolting of a dormant soul into consciousness." He makes a bursting motion with his hands, splaying his fingers wide.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>48</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Thus, to Awaken one of the former dwarves of Durgan's Battery, you will need to address that soul. Preferably by name." He folds his hands together, steepling his fingers.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>49</ID>
      <DefaultText>"But show some care. When you examine these souls - whatever it is you Watchers do - you may see images. Memories."

He leans forward, his back hunched.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>50</ID>
      <DefaultText>"These are moments of special import. What you see will tell you much about the person. And - perhaps - the condition in which they Awaken." He raises his hoary eyebrows and tilts his head back.</DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>53</ID>
      <DefaultText>"But the ones that came before you, I think they got close. You may wish to find them and see what they discovered."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>54</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I have not seen them since they first came to see me several weeks ago. But word has reached my ears that they crossed an ogre matron." His mouth twists into a wry line.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>55</ID>
      <DefaultText>"But this Awakening would be permanent, wouldn't it?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Oh, yes."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>57</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Whoever you Awaken will live with the memories and the personality of a past life. Maybe peacefully, maybe not." His bony shoulders rise in a shrug.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>58</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I see. Thank you for your help."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"You? Go to Stalwart? Is this your macabre sense of humor, or has something gone to rust in that beautiful head I crafted?" Galvino stares at her, agape.</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>63</ID>
      <DefaultText>"No one'll bother me while I'm with him. 'Sides, I can help him find people in Stalwart."

The golem's burnished face is eerily impassive.</DefaultText>
