      <DefaultText>There is a shallow basin at the foot of the furnace, and in the eye sockets of the skull itself are golden rings, evidently meant to house some manner of gem or instrument.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The dragon skull gazes down upon you with hollow eyes. Both have gleaming golden rings worked into the sockets, and both of these stand empty. In the basin at the base of the furnace, you note a rectangular gap, as if something once sat within.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The dragon skull bears a single right eye, formed of a brilliant adra sphere. In the basin at the base of the furnace, you note a rectangular gap, as if something once sat within.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>With a little climbing, you are able to reach the eye socket and carefully wedge the sphere into place. It fits snugly, and you think you sense a small ripple of energy as the eye is set within.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You feel a faint vibration through the skull. It grows in intensity until the very ground seems to shake, loose cobblestones rattling in their settings. You leap from the furnace to confront what is coming...</DefaultText>

      <ID>16</ID>
      <DefaultText>You hear a rush of air, and the clunk of some mechanism deep within the furnace. The air around the forge seems to be growing warmer, though the furnace itself remains dark and still...</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The air shifts almost imperceptibly around you - the adra sphere you have placed suddenly blazes with an orange light, fading from a blinding brightness to the vibrant glow of a campfire.</DefaultText>

      <ID>18</ID>
      <DefaultText>You climb into position, and carefully set the adra sphere into the golden ring at the center of the skull's eye socket. The sphere fits perfectly, and as it drops into place a peculiar burst of energy ripples outward from the dragon's eye, and through you.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The dragon skull's eyes blaze, and the chamber grows steadily hotter. You hear the groan and whine of strained metal, and there is a weight in the air as if the furnace itself were waiting, expectantly, for one final action.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>From deep within the furnace comes a startling, metallic screech, as if some hidden mechanism has come to life. From the vents around you rises hot, stale air, and the glow of rising fires.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You place the stone disc into the basin, and find that it fits perfectly within the hollow. Before your eyes, the disc turns of its own accord, rotating this way and that before finally sinking into position.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The impressive skull of the forge furnace looms above you. From time to time the hiss of wind emerges from the depths.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>A large, stone dragon skull stands silent vigil at one end of this circular chamber. Within its maw is a network of steel dividers, tubes and vents, indicating that this impressive construction served as the furnace for the White Forge.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>A thin smoke rises from both orbs, and in the depths of the furnace you think you hear the rattling of machinery...</DefaultText>

      <ID>28</ID>
      <DefaultText>A gust of hot air erupts from the stone dragon's maw. Molten ore drips from the basin, and dark, billowing smoke begins to gush from between the skull's fangs.</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>29</ID>
      <DefaultText>You hear another rending shriek - but not of machinery. Around you rises a chorus of howls, bodiless voices raised in rage and despair.</DefaultText>
