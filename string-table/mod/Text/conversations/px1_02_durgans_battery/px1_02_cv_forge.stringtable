      <DefaultText>You perceive the tenuous connections between the souls and the battery. As you sever them, the souls cry out, some in relief and others in rage. 

Pressure builds in the ether, which swarms with essence and energy. You cover your ears and grit your teeth against the devastating hum that builds in the core of your soul.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The souls flow up and through the bricks, moving away from the White Forge as if from a burning, beating heart. The walls groan and creak at the sudden rush of energy.

At last you feel them distantly as they clot somewhere above you, around the exterior of the keep. They thrum with energy and purpose.</DefaultText>

      <ID>64</ID>
      <DefaultText>You feel a plunging sensation as the energy of dozens of souls rushes toward the White Forge. It buffets you like a storm wind, and you brace yourself against it.

Finally, the ether grows still again, and you feel new power radiating from the White Forge. It emanates a warmth that you feel in your soul, yet you know that you could draw close to it without fearing the heat of its fires.</DefaultText>
