      <DefaultText>The world around you blurs and fades to black. When your vision returns, you find yourself in a small wooden hut, its interior dimly lit by the embers in a nearby firepit.
 
You're wearing mail armor several sizes too large for you, and clutched in your hands is the ivory horn of some sea creature, one end sharpened to a point.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The world fades and your vision blurs. When it returns, you find yourself in the icy waters of a bay, your body numb from the cold and your lungs burning from exertion.

Nearby are Ardhel and Badrwn. Both of them are swimming madly in an effort to pass you.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Give up, Garodh!" Ardhel passes you, and despite your best efforts, you can't quite catch up.

You look around to see where Badrwn is, and it's by sheer chance that you catch sight of the sea serpent's head surging towards your group.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>On the distant shore await the other members of your tribe, and with them, Olarra, daughter of the chieftain. It is for her hand that the three of you are competing today.</DefaultText>

      <ID>6</ID>
      <DefaultText>You grit your teeth against the sudden pain and wrap your arms around the serpent's neck before it can turn around. It thrashes and rolls wildly, trying to throw you off. 

You hang on for dear life, weaker with every breath as your blood drains.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"The race. How could I have forgotten the events of that day?"

Garodh looks at his hands. "I remember it now, but I feel no different yet. Please, you must find the last part of my helm!"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You remain standing, sheer willpower keeping you up, until you're certain that you are the undisputed winner of the combat. It's not until the last of the enemy warriors have left your village that you allow yourself to collapse.

The last thing you ever remember is the hands of your people reaching out to catch you.</DefaultText>

"I entrust my helm to your care."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>No sooner does your mind touch on the possibility than the world lurches back into motion and a thunderous impact strikes the door.

The door crashes inward as the young girl screams. A large creature, resembling a bear and taller than any man in your tribe, steps into the hut with a triumphant roar.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>No sooner does your mind touch on the possibility than the world lurches back into motion.

A large creature, resembling a bear and taller than any man in your tribe, stands just outside the door. Its coal-black eyes widen slightly in confusion when it sees you.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>22</ID>
      <DefaultText>You charge and plunge the horn deep into the creature's chest. It roars in agony and reels back, but quickly retaliates, swatting you across the hut with one massive paw.

Caitha dodges past the creature and escapes the hut.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>As it has twice before, your vision blurs and fades to black. When it returns, you find yourself on your knees, a shattered sword in your hand and a broken, battered helm in front of you. Your helm.</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>48</ID>
      <DefaultText>You can feel blood pouring down one side of your face, and you know for certain that you will never see out of your left eye again.

Arrayed around you in a circle are other warriors, some from your tribe, the rest from an enemy tribe. They watch the combat in silence.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You do the only thing you think of and jam your fist straight through the serpent's eye, burying your arm as far it can go. 

The serpent whips around in agony, and your grip slips. You tumble through the air as your consciousness fades.</DefaultText>

      <ID>70</ID>
      <DefaultText>Your fatigue falls away as you turn to face the serpent. It charges you, its jaws wide, its foot-long teeth flashing in the sunlight.

At the last moment, you dodge to the side as its jaws snap shut. You're a hair too slow, and one of the serpent's horns tears open your forearm to the bone.</DefaultText>

      <ID>75</ID>
      <DefaultText>You dash past the creature before it can react and sprint away from the hut. The creature doesn't pursue and turns its attentions to Caitha.

Your sister's cries of agony and the creature's growls fade...</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"What are we going to do, Garodh?" 

Your sister, Caitha, huddles near you, her wide eyes fixated on the hut's door, which has been barred shut. The door shudders and splinters beneath heavy blows coming from the other side. Enraged growling can be heard just beyond the door.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>No sooner does your mind touch on the possibility than the world lurches back into motion and a thunderous impact strikes the door.

The door crashes inward as the young girl screams. A large creature, resembling a bear and taller than any man in your tribe, steps into the hut with a triumphant roar.

It doesn't notice you crouched beside the door.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Enraged by your audacity, the creature charges, easily swatting you across the hut with one massive paw. As it does so, Caitha dodges past the creature and escapes the hut.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You plunge the horn deep into the creature's back, and it howls and thrashes in agony. Caitha dodges past the creature and flees the hut, and you're not far behind.

The roars of the creature fade...</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Each breath is agony, but you clutch the horn defiantly as the creature advances.

    <Entry>
      <ID>95</ID>
      <DefaultText>You keel over, surreptitiously grabbing one of the broken horns of your helm as you do. You lie there, eyes closed, listening for your opponent's approach, trusting in his arrogance to come within striking distance.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>104</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Pathetic." You hear the crunch of the other warrior's feet near your head, and in a flash you strike, driving the horn upwards into your foe's unarmored groin.

He howls in agony, but you keep striking again and again until he's silent.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You take a deep breath, dive, and remain perfectly still, avoiding the serpent's notice. 

In moments, the deep blue water around you turns red and cloudy. You wait until you see the shadowy form of the serpent silently gliding away before you surface with a gasp.</DefaultText>

      <ID>107</ID>
      <DefaultText>There's no sign of your companions, and you make your way to shore. 

Your tribe's initial cheers at your arrival fade once you relate your story about the encounter with the sea serpent, claiming that you only survived by sheer luck.</DefaultText>

      <ID>112</ID>
      <DefaultText>"You're going to die, old man." Your opponent is brash, but young and strong. "You still think single combat was a good idea?"

You do. Last winter's famine took a heavy toll on your tribe, and your warriors were in no shape to fend off an all-out attack from its enemies. Single combat was your tribe's only hope.

But not if you lose.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He's ready for you. His blade bites deep into your side - a mortal blow. He laughs, but the last laugh is yours.

You are older and you are slower, but you're still strong. You seize the young warrior's head and with a roar of triumph, snap his neck and drop his corpse into the mud.</DefaultText>
