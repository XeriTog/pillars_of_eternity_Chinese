      <DefaultText>The ice that varnishes the chute feels slick and smooth - it won't offer any traction. The faint echoes from the depths suggest that it's a long way down.

However, you notice a thick stalagmite nearby. It looks sturdy enough to hold a rope and grappling hook.</DefaultText>

Until the chute opens into a wide cavern around you. You lower yourself hand-over-hand, keeping your half-numbed fingers wrapped around the rope. You still can't see the bottom.

But as you look around, a glint of light catches your eye.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The hook tumbles from its anchor above you. 

You pick up speed, wind whistling past your ears and a scream tearing from your throat.

You slam against jagged rocks and hard ice, tumbling down the narrow tunnel as the world spins around you. With a final crash, the chute spits you out into an open cavern. Fortunately, your divine protection has absorbed the brunt of the damage.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You begin climbing up the rope. 

It creaks under your considerable weight, swinging wildly as you scramble and flounder.

Suddenly, it slips from the anchor above.</DefaultText>
