      <DefaultText>"Watch it! Distract me again and you're like to lose an eye."

Even as she speaks, the aumaua looks not at you, but at a row of weapons laid out on a table.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Cataloging weights. Centers of gravity. Controlling a three-and-a-half foot blade in the air is harder than it looks." She balances a sword between her index fingers and jots a note.</DefaultText>

      <ID>9</ID>
      <DefaultText>She shows you a row of sharp teeth. "That filthy spider put you up to this? He's using you, you know. Thinks he can control you like one of his mindless puppets." Her eyes dart from the weapons on her work table to you.</DefaultText>

      <ID>17</ID>
      <DefaultText>She nods. "Good. Take this, too."

"Now, just so we're clear, I don't know your business with him, and I don't want to, either." She folds her arms.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>18</ID>
      <DefaultText>"That's a good start. Let me know when you've found the rest and I'll give you the my piece."</DefaultText>

      <ID>19</ID>
      <DefaultText>"So if you get into trouble, don't expect me at your side. Far as I'm concerned, our business is happily concluded."

She gives you a smart nod and returns to her work.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Like I said, leave me out of your business with Concelhaut."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>21</ID>
      <DefaultText>She scratches the back of her head. "He's not someone you want to cross. Or disappoint. You know, I really should get back to work."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>23</ID>
      <DefaultText>She grins and shakes her head. "Concelhaut hasn't even bothered to come out of his study since the attack started, so why should I worry?"</DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>24</ID>
      <DefaultText>"If Concelhaut didn't want you here, you'd have known it the moment you came down those stairs." 

Uariki pauses. "And then you'd be dead, if you were lucky."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>28</ID>
      <DefaultText>She turns to you, a puzzled frown on her face. "You've heard of Concelhaut, right? One of the greatest wizards in the world?" She gestures around her. "All this belongs to him."</DefaultText>

      <ID>29</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Aside from me, there are three other apprentices working on their own projects. I don't know anything about Sabel or Pelden, but stay away from Tanoss, the vithrack - there's something about him I don't trust."</DefaultText>

      <ID>34</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I'm going to continue my research. Perhaps Concelhaut has some lore in his library that could prove useful. Now, if you'll excuse me, I must get back to work."</DefaultText>
