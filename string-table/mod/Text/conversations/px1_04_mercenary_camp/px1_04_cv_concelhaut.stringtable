      <DefaultText>An emaciated figure hunches over a stack of books. As you enter the room, it rises, and you feel as though you can see each rib and vertebrae shift into place beneath a pale film of flesh.

It turns, twisting wasted skin and tendons around its bones. Two eyes burn from its angular, shrunken face.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>A dry croak of laughter tumbles from the lich's throat.

"I can deal with whatever pathetic mercenary band my rivals have sent after my phylactery."

He runs a bony finger along his cheek. His eyes dim thoughtfully.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"And steal my phylactery for yourself, yes?"

A dry croak of laughter tumbles from the lich's throat.

"You would not be the first to try."</DefaultText>

      <ID>12</ID>
      <DefaultText>The flesh around his mouth puckers. "A phylactery is no mere 'artifact.' It's the repository of a soul and a work of sophisticated magic." 

He cocks his head.</DefaultText>

    <Entry>

      <DefaultText>"Spells are fueled by ambient essence in the ether. A miserly trickle of energy that leaks from the Wheel." He traces arcane shapes in the air around him.</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>18</ID>
      <DefaultText>"But imagine what could be done with a more powerful source of essence. A Watcher's soul, for instance." His eyes flash. A rictus grin twists his lips.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>A dry croak of laughter tumbles from the lich's throat.

"I have poured my soul into a phylactery to extend my own life and knowledge. My apprentices spend years in their laboratories, toiling over new enchantments for the privilege of learning at my feet."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"A phylactery isn't some bauble I wear around my neck or hide in a chest. It's a complex layer of spellwork carved into my skull with runes and sealed with a peg of adra." The sparse flesh stretched across his cheeks twitches at the memory.</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>30</ID>
      <DefaultText>He laughs. "In my eyes or theirs? You've surely heard of the great archmages of Eora - Ninagauth, Minoletta, Citzal, and Kalakoth. Arkemyr and Llengrath, too."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>

    <Entry>
      <ID>32</ID>
      <DefaultText>"The most demanding and visionary kind! The kind that wizards have argued over for centuries! Names like Caedebald the Red and Maura of the Seven Hills. Even you must know of them." He leans forward, his bones rattling in his fervor.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Indeed. And what a triumph it would be." He flexes his bone-thin fingers.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>36</ID>
      <DefaultText>"The power to warp and wind time. Like a skein of wool wrapped about your finger. To strangle its flow to a mere trickle. Perhaps to reverse it altogether." The pits of his eyes burn fever-bright.</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>49</ID>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>55</ID>
      <DefaultText>"A shame that you should throw off one yoke only to find another." Concelhaut's eyes glitter.</DefaultText>
