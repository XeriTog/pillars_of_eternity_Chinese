      <DefaultText>"Commander Baelorin, leader of the Torn Bannermen. You've been a right pain in the balls, whoever you are. What do I call you?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I've lost a lot of fucking men out there. Concelhaut's one thing, but why are you here, cutting down my soldiers?"</DefaultText>

      <ID>7</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Not sure how you managed to get through our fucking lines without having to cut your way through. Clearly I've been soft on the lads. I'm sure they appreciate your being gentle."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Baelorin inclines his head politely. 

"Well, [Player Name]. On behalf of the Torn Bannermen, welcome to our camp." 

His men glance at each other, smirking.</DefaultText>

      <ID>9</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Only if you'd like to be remembered as something other than 'the fool that wandered into our camp'."

"But that's all right. I'm sure we'll have it out of you soon enough."</DefaultText>

      <ID>10</ID>
      <DefaultText>Baelorin smiles thinly.

"No sense making this more unpleasant than it has to be. Even a few minutes can be made to feel like eternity."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I've heard that there is an artifact of great power within the tower."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Your mercenaries attacked me without cause."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I'm here to fight for Concelhaut."</DefaultText>

      <ID>16</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I won't allow Concelhaut's work to fall into the hands of mercenaries."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>17</ID>
      <DefaultText>Baelorin nods slowly, unsurprised. 

"You and half the Dyrwood. Makes a tempting prize for lords and bandits alike."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>18</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I mean to find the Engwithan Phylactery."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>19</ID>
      <DefaultText>"But the artifact is ours. Whoever set their tongue to wagging about it, they did you a great wrong. Nobody comes into our camp and lives." 

He gestures to the guards. 
"Think that's about the end of it. You ready? I'll make it quick for you."</DefaultText>

      <ID>20</ID>
      <DefaultText>A flicker of surprise crosses Baelorin's features.

"Well, fuck me sideways. Didn't think there were too many people outside this camp that knew just what we're after."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>21</ID>
      <DefaultText>Baelorin's expression sours. 

"My men had orders to warn off any intruders, without unnecessary bloodshed. Every one of them knows I expect my commands followed to the fucking letter, and gods help the man that slips."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>22</ID>
      <DefaultText>"No, I'd say you're here for the same reason as the rest of us. A powerful artifact, hidden within the keep... That's bait to tempt any beast."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>23</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Ah. You're, what, rushing to the defense of an old man?" 

Baelorin chuckles. "Concelhaut's got any number of treasures in that tower of his. But he never got the hang of making allies."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>24</ID>
      <DefaultText>"That so? Real noble of you. Coming down  here to risk death at the hands of the Torn Bannermen for... what? Concelhaut's books? His alembics? A fucking mortar and pestle?"</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>25</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Wait- I have some questions, before we begin."</DefaultText>

      <ID>29</ID>
      <DefaultText>Baelorin considers you for a few long moments. Then he shrugs a shoulders. 

"Suppose there's no harm in that.  I don't promise I'll answer."

He motions for you to continue.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"What do you know about the Engwithan Phylactery?"</DefaultText>

      <ID>33</ID>
      <DefaultText>"What do you know about this artifact?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"How goes the siege?"</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>35</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Only that the Phylactery's worth a fucking fortune. More than your usual piece of Engwithan history, I mean."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>36</ID>
      <DefaultText>"No idea what it does. Don't much care. Our employer wants it found, and delivering it's going to see us paid enough coin to buy one of the Republics."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>37</ID>
      <DefaultText>"After tactical advice?" 

Baelorin grunts. "Was going well enough at first. But the moment we cracked open the outer wall, Concelhaut's pets started clawing their way out of the ruins."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>38</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Once the reinforcements arrive, we will storm the keep in force. Just a matter of time." 

"Could prop your corpse up somewhere, after. You could scare off the looters."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>39</ID>
      <DefaultText>"You slaughter my fucking men, and then come begging after work? They'd have my guts for bowstrings if I took you on, and I'd deserve it."

"You came ready to kill. Don't lose your nerve now."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>40</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Shame of it is, I might have welcomed you under the banner, under different circumstances. But the contract's clear- no outside elements. You understand."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>41</ID>
      <DefaultText>Baelorin chuckles quietly.

"Someone without much love for Concelhaut, eh? Let's just say they have a lot of coin to throw around, and high standards. Thing is, discretion's included in the service."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>42</ID>
      <DefaultText>"What of Concelhaut? Does he live?"</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>43</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Good question. No one's got a clear sense of that. We haven't seen him on the field of battle."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>44</ID>
      <DefaultText>"The old fuck may have gotten himself eaten by the dead men. He could be controlling them."

"Or the first volley of stones left him crushed under his own keep."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>46</ID>
      <DefaultText>Baelorin shrugs.

"Won't know until we get in there and see for ourselves."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />

    <Entry>
      <ID>48</ID>
      <DefaultText>"What were these creatures?"</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>49</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Dead men, walking and fighting like the living. They've armor thick enough to foul our arrows, and they can conjure spells to burn a man alive."

He looks out toward the nearby hill.</DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>50</ID>
      <DefaultText>"At night you can see them on the bluff, like a line of torches. Their eyes, burning..." 

Baelorin clears his throat. "They don't come down into our camp. They wait up there, for us to come to them."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>51</ID>
      <DefaultText>Baelorin raises his blade in a quick salute. 

"I'll give Concelhaut your regards."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Hold, hold. He's got this far, I ought to have a look at him at least." 

The man before you has the bearing of authority, and his casual command has the guards immediately lowering their weapons. Even so, they continue to watch you warily.</DefaultText>
