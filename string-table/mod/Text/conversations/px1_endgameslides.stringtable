      <DefaultText>The Hollowborn scourge ended, and healthy children were born once more in the villages of the White March.

Yet this new generation displayed an uncanny vigor and a hunger for exploration. In time, they would push across the White March, establishing new towns and restoring forgotten settlements. 

What had once been a region in decline became a thriving frontier, known for its famous artisans and explorers.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Even after the Hollowborn scourge ended, the White March remained a difficult and dangerous place. 

Yet it was made safer by Durgan's Battery. The cannons atop the old fortress protected the roads from bandits and ogres, and the keep became a place of refuge for the villagers in the region.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The Hollowborn scourge ended, and as news of the White Forge spread, smiths came from near and far to labor by its fires.

It drew the attention and envy of several governments, but it also revitalized the region. Once more, the White March grew famous and prosperous for its metalworking.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Unfortunately, Stalwart's ambition to reopen its mines died with Taena. After she passed, there were none left in the village with the experience and expertise to oversee the project.

Stalwart would profit from the traffic of traders and artisans seeking the White Forge, but without their own source of ore, they saw other villages grow rich while they remained fishers and hunters.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Under Taena's guidance, Stalwart's mines were restored, albeit slowly and with half a dozen accidents. However, this did not forestall the arrival of scores of prospectors, many of them brigands and outlaws, and all of them eager to profit from the White Forge.

By the time Stalwart reopened its mines, half a dozen others had been excavated in the nearby peaks. The lawless men and women who ran them became a constant source of competition and violence for the beleaguered village.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>With her newfound energy, Taena oversaw the restoration of Stalwart's mines faster than any could have expected. As word spread about Durgan's Battery, artisans and smiths came to rely on the village's steady supply of ore. Their coin paved wide roads, built sturdy walls, and renewed hope for the people of Stalwart.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The opening of Durgan's Battery created ample opportunities for the smugglers that already prowled the mountains. The law-abiding villagers of Stalwart did their best to bar the gates against these ruffians, yet they somehow found a way into the village, where they spit in the streets and shouted over games of dice. 

While the villagers fretted and gossiped about their rowdy visitors, few noticed Owynna's midnight errands, or the extra coin that passed to her as she served food and drink to the boisterous patrons.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Despite the discovery of the White Forge, the Watcher's visit to Stalwart was long hailed as an ill omen. Few could talk about the path blazed through Durgan's Battery without a whispered prayer for the dead left in the Watcher's wake.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Even as Stalwart memorialized the discovery of the White Forge, the arrival of the Watcher became an even more celebrated occasion. For the Watcher had given them not only Durgan's Battery, but also hope for their own village.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Yet for Stalwart, the name of the White Forge was flavored with bitterness. It reminded people of the Watcher, a mysterious scoundrel who had given them the White Forge but taken much from their village.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>And while Stalwart celebrated the discovery of the White Forge, they spoke little of the Watcher. Eventually, the Watcher's name faded from their tales, even while the White Forge blazed on.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Harmke's death had brought the Devil of Caroc little satisfaction. In time, her taste for vengeance soured. What replaced it was a hunger to feel something - anything - new.

Summer had thinned the snowpack twice over when she felt the joint at her elbow first begin to stiffen. She turned her back on the hopes of animancy and civilization and walked east.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Releasing Harmke left the Devil of Caroc with a gnawing dissatisfaction that continued to eat at her long after the Watcher confronted Thaos.

She resumed her search for the men and women who had razed Cold Morn, clinging to the hope that enacting her revenge might one day allow her to feel something.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She pushed through the mountains, past Readceras, and into the broad plains of Ixamitl. She had forgotten what it was like to simply journey, no goal or destination in mind. 

Though she felt nothing more than the steady thump of her feet on the road, the endless horizons and grassy meadows were new to her. She measured her time in the gradual rusting of her body and was satisfied.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Yet as she hunted and killed, the futility of her actions grew like a leaden weight in her gut. Her movements grew stiff and sluggish as her zeal deserted her. 

One day, she found herself surrounded in Maiden Falls. As she tried to fight back against the villagers, she felt her arms stick in their sockets and her legs buckle beneath her. 

The villagers tore her body apart and shattered its segments while she screamed, feeling none of it.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Her movements slowed, but so did the world around her. Waist-high grasses undulated and tacked in the wind, as gradual as the tides. Sparrows and blackjays made steady pilgrimages across the sky, each flap of their wings a solemn salute.

She could hardly move when she found something she had never seen before - the ocean. With the last of her strength, she pulled herself beneath the waves, content at last to feel the movement of currents and the constant caress of the waves.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Zahua came to peace with the loss of his master's knowledge, and decided instead to start anew.

He traveled back to Coldflow Lake, where the monastery of the Thousand Dreams remained empty.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>There, he reestablished the Nalpazca order, and taught all he could remember of his master's teachings.

Would-be disciples traveled great distances to learn from the old master, and in time, they took disciples of their own in turn.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Seeing himself as the last messenger of the teachings of Ixepillo, Zahua sought out an apprentice who embodied the spirit of the Nalpazca.

Finding one in a vicious Defiance Bay bar fight, Zahua took her under his wing and taught her everything he remembered learning from his master.

He asked her to promise to do the same before sending her onward, and she obliged.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Zahua saw that his master's teachings were lost to the world, and that he was to blame for it.

He began to journey aimlessly, seeking punishment and suffering, craving the moments of clarity they brought him.

 But they would remain only moments, as true enlightenment continued to elude him.</DefaultText>
