    <Entry>
      <ID>92</ID>
      <DefaultText>"But then I lift my head. See a bronze corpse stretching out in front of me."

    <Entry>
      <ID>94</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I dream too of what Galvino did that night. Those moments... I'd endure another Cold Morn if it would spare me this fate." She rubs her hands together, tracing her even joints with her fingertips.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>95</ID>
      <DefaultText>"When a crowd of 'em came for me in the dark of night, I was only surprised it had taken them so long." She hesitates.</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>96</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Only they didn't march me to no gallows. No, they snuck me to another house on the edge of town, real sneaky-like.

"That's where I met Galvino." She raises her head, her black eyes shining.</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>98</ID>
      <DefaultText>"By that time, the mayor's goons had me trussed up good and tight. Galvino was having himself a grand time barking orders at that lot."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>99</ID>
      <DefaultText>"So while Galvino's fastening that helmet over my head and them copper bands 'round my arms, I'm starting to look at his contraption.

"And that's when I see it."

Her black eyes are fixed on some indefinable point. Her essence dims.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>100</ID>
      <DefaultText>"It's this metal suit, strapped into the machine just like me. A cold, dead-eyed thing, all done up with fancy carvings and such."

She shivers, her joints chittering.</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>103</ID>
      <DefaultText>"And then... just pain. Being torn apart every which way, feeling my soul peeled from my body." Her limbs twitch and shudder. She pauses, waiting for her body to fall still.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>104</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Think that was when I knew."
