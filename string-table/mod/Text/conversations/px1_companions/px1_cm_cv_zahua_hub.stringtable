      <DefaultText>"They imagine a world without suffering, and dream of living there, and suffer all the more for it."

    <Entry>
      <ID>76</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I still trained with the other instructors. Sparred and meditated with my Nalpazca brothers and sisters. I learned from all of them."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>77</ID>
