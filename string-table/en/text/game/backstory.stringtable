      <DefaultText>In the aftermath of the assassination of the duc, Thaos said something to you that triggered a memory from your past life.

    <Entry>
      <ID>43</ID>
      <DefaultText>He referred to you as “Inquisitor,” and he referred to a growing movement of people gathering around a heretic woman named Iovara ix Ensios. He sought her apprehension.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Another vision of Iovara came to you at the docks of the Burial Isle. She was concerned for her home city, and was contemplating building an army to counter Thaos’ inquisition. You did as Thaos had asked, telling her she should seek refuge in Ossionus, where in fact the king was already prepared to turn her over to the inquisition.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You found yourself in the grand chamber you first saw in the ruins where you originally encountered the Leaden Key. At the foot of the giant adra pillar, you spoke at last to an apparition of Thaos - the one you had intended to ask a question to. The confrontation was about the lies he had told you when he convinced you to remain in the missionary order and had earned your loyalty. You wanted to know if the gods themselves were real. He gave you no direct answer. But he did imply that if you kept asking, you would find yourself at the mercy of the inquisition.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>When you arrived in Gilded Vale, you found that the town was not the growing and prosperous settlement you had been told it was. Instead you found a dying town at the mercy of a phenomenon called Waidwen’s Legacy, and received a cold welcome from the town magistrate. Your prospects of settling in Gilded Vale looked bleaker as it was, but they may have been totally dashed when the tolling bells of Raedric’s Hold announced that their master’s child had not been born in good health. The magistrate advised you to rest at an inn.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You approached the hanged dwarf woman from your dreams and found that through some means you were able to converse with her. You learned that you are a Watcher, perhaps as a result of your brush with death at the ruins, and that this has given you some kind of otherworldly vision, though the dwarf was able to tell you few details. She advised you to speak to an old Watcher named Maerwald who is master of a keep in the area and might be able to help.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Maerwald was in the dungeons of his own keep, hiding from spirits hallucinated by his own tortured mind. His soul was Awakened to his past lives, and some irreconcilable conflict from long ago within him seemed to have driven him mad. He cautioned you that you may share his condition, as well as his fate. However, he did also suggest that there may be a way to undo your Awakening. He told you to seek out the Leaden Key, the group you saw before at the ruins, and to determine from them how to undo it.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>With the help of an animancer named Aldhelm and an ancient language expert named Icantha, both of whom functioned despite their own deaths, you were able to learn that the machine atop the tower in Heritage Hill, Teir Nowneth, has the ability to anchor souls to their bodies, causing those bodies to remain animated even in death. What was more, Icantha explained that there are other similar machines scattered throughout the Dyrwood that function as relays, sending souls from one place to the next.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>In Brackenbury Sanitarium, you found the man you were searching for. He had taken possession of the body of a patient there, and he seemed to be using it to ruin the career of a man who had once been one of Dyrwood’s most prominent animancers, a man who had been working on a cure for Waidwen’s Legacy. The man wasn’t interested in helping you with your Awakening - at least not voluntarily. He made a hasty exit from the sanitarium, sending his soul from body to body, and left you to clean up the mess.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You met Lady Webb in her chambers in Hadret House. She wanted to know why you pursued the Leaden Key, and was able to tell you about the man you were looking for, Thaos ix Arkannon, a man who reincarnates with a perfect memory of his past lives, and who orchestrates plots that take lifetimes to come to fruition.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>With everything you’ve seen you were able to convince Lady Webb that the Leaden Key was behind Waidwen’s Legacy, and that their plot involved animancers taking the blame for it. She advised you to seek out Duc Aevar Wolf-grin, who is currently holding hearings at the palace on the future of animancy. She thought he would listen to your case, provided you were able to secure an invite to the hearings.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>At the base of the two giant trees, you met a pair of delemgan sisters. They explained to you that your cause was misguided, for no Awakening can be undone, but they did still see value in your quest, explaining that if you could find the root of what troubled your soul, you might yet be able to resolve it. In either case, only Thaos would have the knowledge I seek. I am to pursue him to a subterranean Engwithan city called Sun in Shadow. The delemgan offered a path there, but it is one I will not be able to follow without the intervention of the gods.</DefaultText>
