      <DefaultText>A gaudy necklace lies on the ground, its clasp broken and the paste gemstones shattered. It looks worthless, even without the damage, but it's filled with essence.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You open your eyes. Elcga lies beside you, motionless but for long, slow breaths. You kick off her silken sheets and tiptoe downstairs, taking your clothes with you.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Back on the streets of Brackenbury, the nobles cast disdainful glances in your direction. To them, you're little better than one of those whores at the Salty Mast. But one day, someone will recognize your worth.

Someone other than Elcga. She's entertaining enough and as generous as they come, but she's just a stepping stone for you. Soon, you won't need her handouts.

That you managed to string her along these months only proves that you're perfect for this new job.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The actress with silvered eyes has invited you over. She's trying to prepare you for your big role, but you're not really listening. Instead, you're checking out your surroundings. 

Not as extravagant as you would have thought, but this job is just a start for you. Soon, you'll meet wealthy patrons - perhaps some who are even freer with their coin than Elcga - and you'll be on your way. This is just the beginning.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The actress stops prattling and opens a trapdoor in the floor. The space below is as cold and dark as the grave. Despite the screaming in your mind, your legs keep moving forward.</DefaultText>
