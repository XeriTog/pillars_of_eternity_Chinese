      <DefaultText>Her hand rests on the table, and she clenches it into a white-knuckled fist. "There's nothing more to say to him. We're finished. I just want to give this back to him and have a clean break."

She opens her hand, and a ring clatters onto the table.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Kaenra looks surprised. "Other than a bunch of good-for-nothings rotting away on svef? Don't get me wrong, if there's another explanation, I'd love to know, I just... I probably shouldn't go back there myself.

      <DefaultText>A woman sits by herself, spinning something on the table in front of her and watching it with furious intensity. It's about the size of a coin, and it wobbles over a crack in the wood with a metallic rattle.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She says nothing for a few moments, as if hoping you'll leave. At last, Kaenra looks up at you, and lamplight falls across her face. A purpling bruise is blossoming along her cheekbone. 

"There's something I need to give to my fianc&#233;, Purnisc. Only he doesn't seem to go anywhere without his new friends, and they're not exactly pleasant company."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"They come into our house with their dead eyes and their black teeth. I'm not a fool, I know what it means. Purnisc makes me leave when they show up, but it's obvious what they come to do.

"Last time they came, I told them to get out. Let them have their fun somewhere in the Gift, but not under my roof." She scowls and then winces, her fingertips gently probing her bruise.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I don't see the joke." She eyes you suspiciously. "...You really don't know? It's a shrub, I think. From out in the mountains somewhere. It has dark berries, and they treat them somehow. Make this pulpy paste."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"It was his grandmother's. Even after this, I don't have the heart to sell it off. But if I go back there myself, I know what'll happen. I lose my temper, and I'll probably wind up with another one of these." She points to her bruise.</DefaultText>

      <ID>104</ID>
      <DefaultText>She shakes her head. "I know how this looks, but you don't understand. It's not like Purnisc. It's these new friends of his, they've brought out the worst in him."</DefaultText>

      <ID>105</ID>
      <DefaultText>She brings her fist down on the table, sloshing her drink. "Damn it! How can I trust him after something like this? That he's lied to me for this long..."
