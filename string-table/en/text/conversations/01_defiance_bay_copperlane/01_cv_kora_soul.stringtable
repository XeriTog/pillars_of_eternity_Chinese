      <DefaultText>A simple silken scarf is crumpled on the filthy flagstones. Essence radiates from it like heat, and the closer you get to it, the more you feel a confusing mixture of joy, surprise, and pain.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You hold the scarf and focus on it, and the world around you shifts. Something about you shifts, too. The smooth fabric is still in your hands, but you're in a small yet cozy house, and Lora is looking from the scarf back to you, asking if you like it. She's smiling because the answer is written on your face.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>That was four years ago, but you still wear the scarf on days like today. After all, you wore it that first day you met the actress with silvered eyes, so who's to say it won't bring you luck again tonight?</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>It's nestled around your throat, soft and warm and comforting. You're halfway through the third act, and you can feel the audience's eyes on you, hungry and attentive. You were nervous at first when that woman brought you down here, you wondered what kind of show you'd signed up for. But this has gone better than you could have hoped.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You reach the end of your monologue, and the scarf tightens around your neck. It chokes the final line from your throat, which is embarrassing, because your debut was going so well. But when you try to pull the scarf away, it only tightens further. You're confused, and you look to the audience, expecting someone to rush to your rescue. Then you see their eyes, and that hungry, attentive look, and you understand. The stage fades to black.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The scarf falls from your hand and flutters to the ground, but Kora's soul lingers, stuck between a familiar token and a question. It wants to know, but it wants to retreat.</DefaultText>
