      <DefaultText>A broken belt buckle lies on the floor. As cheap and worthless as it looks, essence is anchored to it, expectant and confused.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>As you reach toward the buckle, the soul inhabiting it fills you like a strong drink. If feels like you're stumbling, but the woman grasping your hand guides you onward. Her silvered eyes cut through the fog in your head, but the strength of the grip in those soft fingers sends you reeling again.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>It's been a lifetime since a woman looked at you like that, much less a woman like her. You've been fooled by drink before, but something about the way everyone else at Maea's looked at her tells you that she truly is breathtaking. It's like you told Oly - things are changing for you.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You must have forgotten the last several minutes, but you're in her house now. You're a man on a swaying deck, but that bed at the other end of the room is a safe harbor. But that's not where she's taking you.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>When you slide back into awareness, you're in a cold, dark room. The smell of rubbish and rot is barely masked by the heavy odor of burning tallow. All you can see in the candlelight are rows of ancient brick and her, right in front of you. It feels like a dream but for the searing pain in your chest. You try to touch her to see if she's real, but like everything in dreams, she's just beyond your reach. You fall.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You return to awareness and rise from the floor, but the soul remains with the buckle, moored to the conviction that it will awaken from this strange dream soon enough.</DefaultText>
