      <DefaultText>She waves a manicured hand. "Quite easily. My patrons appreciate true art, and they pay well for it. The actors, on the other hand..." She shrugs. "They were nobodies. In death, I gave them purpose. Is it not telling that the authorities never bothered to look for them?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She pauses, watching for your reaction. "You and I both want to get out of here alive. But no doubt you need a scapegoat. It just so happens that I know someone who's perfect for that part."</DefaultText>
