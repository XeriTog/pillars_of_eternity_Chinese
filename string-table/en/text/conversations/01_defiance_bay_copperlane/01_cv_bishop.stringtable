      <DefaultText>The man behind the bar is nearly the size of an aumaua. A handle protrudes from his back, and his face is set in a stoic frown. He gives you a small nod. "Here for a drink?"

There's a tiny pewter cup in front of him. He turns it in one broad hand but doesn't drink from it.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Name's Bishop. Used to be a scholar of Berath. Now I run the Goose and Fox and keep the regulars in line." He shifts, and you see a war hammer strapped to his back.

      <DefaultText>"It was founded in the early days of Dyrwoodan independence by a traveling scholar named Erol of Levi. He wanted a place where kith of all backgrounds could gather and hash out the issues facing their new country."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He rests his elbows on the polished wood of the bar. "It didn't take long for the place to fill up. Brackenbury aristocrats argued with dock workers from the Gift while soldiers wrangled with politicians. Dyrwoodans have never been known to turn down an argument." He takes a sip from the tiny cup.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Soon, kith were coming from the farms and settlements, too." He waves at the door, as if expecting a crowd to bustle in. "This place got even more popular with the Vailian sailors than the Salty Mast. And that was the problem."

He drains his cup. "No matter what people say about fair-mindedness and civil debate, there's only so much people will tolerate."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Erol found himself on the wrong side of an argument with the wrong thayn. And when he disappeared a few days later, some said it was the work of that thayn."

He shrugs, spreading his hands over the bar as he surveys the room. "But Erol knew which way the wind was blowing. If you ask me, he skipped town. Hid out somewhere, hoping for rational minds to prevail in Defiance Bay."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"The journey isn't as long as you'd think. It started with Hollowborn. And with this." He takes a black bottle from under the bar and fills the pewter cup. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"It was my sister's son." He takes a drink. "At the beginning of Waidwen's Legacy. He was one of the first. 

"I never expected there would be so many after him. Tragedy is part of the cycle, but it's followed by rebirth. Yet every year, more parents were grieving for their Hollowborn children. And the gods were silent."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He leans forward, crossing his arms on the bar. "Berath promises rebirth. Cycles. But the only cycle I found was this one." He taps the bar. "Have a drink. Have another. And another until I couldn't remember how I got home. Wake up. Come back.

"I finally woke up one day to see my family had packed up and left. For all I know, they'd left days before and I just hadn't noticed. But they were gone. So I came here."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He raises his eyebrows. "Haven't seen anything like that cross my bar, that's for sure." He thumps the smooth wood countertop.

"But I wouldn't wager against someone here having a blade like that. Check upstairs - I saw a group head that way not long ago, carrying plenty of steel."</DefaultText>
