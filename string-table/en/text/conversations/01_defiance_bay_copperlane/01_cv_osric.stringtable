      <DefaultText>This man watches the training adventurers with the disinterested contempt of someone whose skills are wasted in this setting. He barks at one of them. "For the last time Eadwig, keep your fucking blade up! If that dummy was armed it'd have your head off."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"It's treasure hunting, plain and simple. Sponsors put up money, hire adventurers to explore the wilds, looking for ruins mostly. If they come back alive, they split the spoils. If not, it's because they handle their weapons like this lot in front of me who might as well be digging their own graves right now."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I was... formerly... one of the Knights of the Crucible. When I left, they kept my arms and armor. The arms they can have, but the armor belonged to my family. I'd like it back."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He nods with a trace of gratitude. "Then it's Penhelm you're looking for. A low, snake of a man. If he was to die choking on his own black tongue it'd be too kind a fate. He kept it when he had me kicked out."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Osric wavers a moment in disbelief. He looks at you, then back at the breastplate. He reaches for it slowly, as if expecting it to disappear before he can touch it. "How did you manage this?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Osric looks away from you, his jaw protruding. "No. No, they'd like that, I'm sure. But I won't be going. Sooner be torn apart by dogs than give them the satisfaction."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He stares off a moment. "You don't choose to leave knighthood. The Crucible Knights, they may not be a real knighthood, but the oaths you swear are just as true."</DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>40</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Still, turns out that even unofficial knighthoods have politics. You cross the wrong man, suddenly all kinds of accusations are thrown your way, and nobody believes you."</DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>43</ID>
      <DefaultText>"It's a breastplate. Not much to look at, and it's seen far too much use, but it's been in my family since the Liberation."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>44</ID>
      <DefaultText>"But you've recovered it just the same. Here." He reaches into his pocket. "I think you'll find it more than fair.

"When you get the chance, stop by Sonild's shop on the other side of the hall. She sells some of the best gear in the city, and I'll see that she opens her inventory to you."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He tries to look you in the eye, but when he does he appears to reconsider. He sighs. "It commemorates the Order of Magran. Highest order of valor. Awarded to the dead, never the living. Us Dyrwoodans - REAL Dyrwoodans - we don't have nobility or birthrights... unless you're some copperfucker from Aedyr. All we got's the honor we bring to our family name."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"So this," he pauses, considering the weathered metal - a pale image of its former self, but still catching the light, "is something to live up to."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"A shame it ended like that. But he's the lying weasel who started this. You did all I asked, and you are owed much." He withdraws a leather coinpurse from his pocket and hands it to you.

      <DefaultText>Osric's body tenses, but he does not lash out. His voice is low and crackles with menace, like a pit of embers. "You would do all this to trample the memories of a stranger?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"It's a requirement to join the Knights. They have to ensure a novitiate doesn't have a 'subversive lineage.' If Penhelm's superiors found out his affidavit was a fake, his career would be over.

"Every novitiate gets an affidavit from Dunryd Row, and those are stored at Crucible Keep. If you find Penhelm's, one of those ciphers could tell you if it's real."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He leans in closer. "I got word from a reliable source that Penhelm visited a forger in Ondra's Gift right after having his soul lineage read by a cipher in Dunryd Row.

      <DefaultText>Sagani scratches the back of her neck. "If generations of Massuk's traditions are any indication, this Penhelm probably doesn't remember it.
