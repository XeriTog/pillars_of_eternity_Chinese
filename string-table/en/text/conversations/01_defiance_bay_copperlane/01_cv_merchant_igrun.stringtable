      <DefaultText>Igrun stands behind a stall, polishing a broadsword. The patterned flesh around his eyes is crinkled with age, and the muscles in his arms are knotty and lean, but he holds the weapon with ease.

He nods at you. "Come to take a look? You won't find a finer collection of armor and weaponry in Defiance Bay. Outside Sonild's, of course." He flashes a crooked grin.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Just like the Crucible Knights use? Let me guess. You've been talking to that kid, right?" He laughs and shakes his head.

"I'd be tempted to sell it to you anyways and let the little rascal learn his lesson, but a pack of adventurers already took it off my hands."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Folk like that only visit Copperlane to crew up at Admeth's Den Expedition Hall or down a pint at the Goose and Fox. And since they weren't headed into the Den, well... you've got my best guess."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He oils the cloth in his hand. "Made out of a high purity iron ore that comes out of the White March mountains. Traditionally, the smiths at the Crucible Keep have smelted it into daggers and swords, which they only give to the Knights of the Crucible.

"Of course, I'd be surprised if that kid didn't already tell you all of this." He grins.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"She operates in the expedition hall." He jerks a thumb over his shoulder. "Sells the best equipment in the city, but Wenan keeps her on a short leash. Keeps her fine inventory reserved for chartered expeditionists, members of the Dozens, and anyone else he takes a liking to."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Igrun pauses mid-polish, his cloth slowing over the blade. "A lot of steel passes through my hands, friend. I don't make it my business to ask where it all comes from."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He grunts and rolls his eyes. "Fine. Five percent to avoid the hassle. Last thing I need is a shakedown from them, what with my stall being so close to Admeth's Den and the Dozens."</DefaultText>
