      <DefaultText>After a moment, however, he smiles weakly. "Hello, there. Wasn't expecting any visitors down in these parts." He glances around the dim room.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Eorn grimaces. "I've... been a little down on my luck, lately. Didn't have anywhere to stay, so... I thought I'd come down here. Nobody pokes around in the catacombs much... not until you, anyway."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Eorn sighs heavily. "Very well. It's true. I've been hiding from the Knights down here. But it isn't what you think." He ducks his head. "It was an accident." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"The Crucible Knights won't care how it happened. They just want me gone - they won't let me live long enough to see the rope. Please." He looks at you with a pleading expression. "I just want to get out of this city. The second I can get money for passage, I won't trouble anyone again, I swear it. I'll live quietly. But you can't... please, you can't tell them I'm here." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Eorn shakes his head. "Sorry, but I don't know anyone by that name. I know I'm not the only one down here, however. I hear voices, now and then, from across the canal. Sounds like they're coming from the northwest."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Eorn lets out a breath, obviously relieved. "Thank you," he says, with feeling. "Truly. I won't be here much longer, if I can help it. Just... just have to get the coin together." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Eorn's jaw sets, his expression determined. He shakes his head. "No. I'm not going to let them tell it their way. You want me dead, then you can do it with your own hands!"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Eorn's mouth falls open, and his eyes widen. After a few moments he turns away, his brows furrowed. "I thought they'd want to keep things quiet, at least. I didn't think they would..." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The orlan looks away, clearly agitated. "I'm just trying to get by. There's nothing else to it. And if that isn't to your liking there's a whole lot of catacombs out there for you to have all to yourself."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Eorn opens his mouth to snap something, his hands balled into fists... but he thinks better of it. He shakes his head slowly, expression resigned. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>This small orlan man appears to have pulled together some crates and scraps of cloth to make a rather sorry-looking little camp. The thick fur on his limbs is matted, and his clothing smeared with blackening grime. He looks startled as you enter, his eyes widening in alarm.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"It's been hard for me, here in Defiance Bay. I suppose I thought if I got involved in city business, if I made the right friends, it would get easier in time. And it did, really. I made a name for myself, a place. People actually listen to me when I talk... Well, they used to."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"People can get very passionate about these things. We were discussing... I think it was shipping agreements - of all the things to fight over! But this one night this man, he... got very angry. I think maybe he'd had a little too much at the inn." Eorn pauses. "And I guess he didn't like an orlan talking back at him."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Well, the canal there - that's Grogan's Canal. Grogan was the dwarf that planned the whole thing. It runs up through to Ondra's Gift, spills out into the sea there." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Otherwise it's just a lot of bones. There's the warrens, for people that couldn't afford better. But it's all flooded now. The fancier folks, they have their own resting places, down here. Drier places." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I struck him. He came towards me, and I hit him, and he went over like a tree. I guess he struck his head on the way down." Eorn lowers his gaze, and shrugs, helplessly. "Turns out he was a Knight." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"O-oh, it's you. I've heard of you, I think. At least, the description matches." The orlan coughs. "Sorry. I wasn't expecting to see anyone else down here. I hear you've been turning up just about everywhere, of course." He grins weakly. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Eorn lets out a breath, sagging with relief. "Thank you. Truly. I know you're an honest man. I only wish the Knights would hear you out. I'd rather just... explain things." </DefaultText>
