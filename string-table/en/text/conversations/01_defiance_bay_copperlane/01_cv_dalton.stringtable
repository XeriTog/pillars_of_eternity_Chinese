      <DefaultText>This elderly man paces back and forth, taking short, hobbled steps. His gaze is distant, and beneath it are the dark rings of many restless nights. He appears to be having a conversation with someone who isn't there.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Tears spring to the old man's eyes. "There's an entrance just southwest of here, on the other side of the canal." He sniffs and wipes his eyes. "You are truly a gift from the gods. If there's anything you can find of her..."</DefaultText>

      <ID>11</ID>
      <DefaultText>He nods slowly. "Plenty of villains to fight and treasures to find, I'm sure. But if you ever change your mind, I'll be here, waiting for her."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Dalton looks stricken. "But how could I have imagined something so vivid? I was sure I heard her voice..." He sighs and shakes his head. "I've lived past my time. Better that I'd died on that plain with my brothers and sisters in arms."</DefaultText>

      <ID>27</ID>
      <DefaultText>Dalton cradles the amulet in both hands, gazing into it with wonder and bewilderment. "She's here. Back with me at last." He holds it to his cheek, as if hoping to hear her voice or feel her caress. "Perhaps her presence, even like this, will bring me peace."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>39</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Just the memories of my youth in the Northwatch Rangers. Trials and adventures from a lifetime ago." He shakes his head. "Of late, the memory of lost battles and fallen friends has been especially vivid."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"It's been nearly sixty years. We were known throughout the Dyrwood then. We thought we'd adventure together forever, collecting coppers and inspiring songs." The wrinkles around his eyes deepen. "That was until we faced Helig of Thein."</DefaultText>

      <ID>43</ID>
      <DefaultText>"He was a wizard whose experiments in necromancy left a trail of bodies - some reanimated - from Solace Vale to Midwood. We tracked him as he fled toward the Vailian Republics, catching him just west of the Lake of Drowned Tombs." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"A wiser man would have ordered a retreat. Not me. By some curse of the gods, I was knocked out, and when I awoke, my rangers... my Rowyna... they were all dead." He holds empty air in his arms.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"And now you hear this woman's voice?"</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>49</ID>
      <DefaultText>"My friend, my comrade in arms, and my love. We'd planned to adventure together until we grew old enough to settle down and enjoy our fortunes. Young as we were, we couldn't imagine anything would tear us apart."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>50</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I know this sounds like an old man's madness, but I hear her. A voice just over my shoulder, calling to me in my dreams. At night, I see her wandering the catacombs beneath the city, trying to escape."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>52</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Foolish as it sounds, I can't shake the idea that she's somehow down there, waiting for me. I've even ventured below, though it damn near cost me my life." He hesitates. 

"Were I half the warrior I was in my youth, I'd search every grave and rathole. As it is, I'm stuck with this feeble body and the agonizing notion that my love is somehow down there, beyond my help."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>53</ID>
      <DefaultText>Dalton takes it and touches the brilliant crimson gem. "In whatever time I have left, this will be enough. To have her close, to visit her in my dreams, to relive our memories together."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>60</ID>
      <DefaultText>"You want me to chase a dream?" </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>61</ID>
      <DefaultText>"It's more than that, I know it. My dreams were never more than faded memories, but this feels as real and as fresh as the conversation we're having now. 

"If it's payment you're concerned about, I still have plenty of weapons from my old adventuring days. They're well-made, and they'll serve you on the battlefield or at a merchant's stall, as you choose."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>[Give him the amulet.] "From your old adversary, Helig. He trapped her soul inside it."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The man stills as he notices the amulet around your neck. "That was hers... Where did you get it?" </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>68</ID>
      <DefaultText>"This isn't what you want to hear, but releasing her soul back into the cycle would be best for both of you." </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>70</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Destroy it?" He clutches at the amulet. "But to have her back after so long... I couldn't bear to lose her again. Having her near me again would be enough." </DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>79</ID>
      <DefaultText>His eyes harden, and he draws his mouth into a tight line. "I know she's down there. So help me, I'll find a way."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Thank you. My Rowyna and I can finally have peace."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>92</ID>
      <DefaultText>He sighs wearily. "My Rowyna was slain along with the rest of the Rangers by a necromancer called Helig of Thein."</DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>93</ID>
      <DefaultText>"It's been almost sixty years, but suddenly the memories are as fresh and sharp as if they were yesterday. And the dreams..." He shakes his head again.</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>97</ID>
      <DefaultText>Dalton's eyes widen in horror. "No, please! After searching for her for so long..." He gazes at the amulet. "Just to have her close to me, to visit her in my dreams... that would be enough."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>98</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Enough for you, but what about her? If you'd keep her trapped in this amulet for the sake of your own comfort, you're no better than the wizard who imprisoned her."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>99</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Perhaps she found you now so that you could finally say goodbye."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>100</ID>
      <DefaultText>[Give him the amulet.] "If this is really what you want, then take it."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>101</ID>
      <DefaultText>[Destroy the amulet.] "This isn't your choice. Rowyna wants to be released, and I'll honor her wishes."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>102</ID>
      <DefaultText>Dalton's expression withers. "You're right. Please, let me do it." He draws a club with a trembling hand and crushes the amulet. As the gem cracks, you feel essence rush from it.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>103</ID>
      <DefaultText>The old man looks at the shattered gemstone. "Thank you for showing me reason. Perhaps she'll wait for me in the next life." He looks at his hands, shaking. "By the flame, she won't have to wait long."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>104</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Please, take this." He hands you the club. "It's from my old adventuring days. I think it's time I finally let them go."</DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>105</ID>
      <DefaultText>The bloodstone shatters, and as essence departs from the gem, a wail escapes Dalton's lips. He falls to his knees, scooping up the broken fragments and sobbing. </DefaultText>

      <ID>110</ID>
      <DefaultText>His hands ball into fists and his eyes blaze with fury. "Monster! You're no better than Helig. If I had the strength I'd..."

Tears well up in his eyes. "Get away from me. I want nothing more to do with you."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Even now, he feels the soul of his beloved... recognizes the spirit that haunts his memories, his dreams.
