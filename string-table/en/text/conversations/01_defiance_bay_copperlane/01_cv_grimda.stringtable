      <DefaultText>An elderly dwarf surveys the stacks. Her skin looks as tough and wrinkled as a walnut. Despite her stature, she manages to look down her nose at you. "You're welcome to look around, but let the priests and scriveners continue their search."

She shoots the nearest robed figure a withering glare. "Wouldn't do to give them any other excuses."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Thieves made off with an ancient scroll of Wael. They intend to blaspheme by selling that which should remain hidden, a secret of the Hundred Visions."

Her wiry eyebrows arch over her spectacles. "The guards caught one of them but were... overzealous in their interrogation. All they could piece together was something about a farmhouse and the road to Dyrford."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Ah, let me see it!" Grimda rubs her hands together. They sound like two sheets of dried parchment. She takes the scroll and turns it in her hands.

"Yes, indeed." Her fingers trace the paper with surprising gentleness. "You've done well."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"However you can. Kill them, rob them, leave them, it makes no difference to me." She waves a hand and smiles grimly. "I'll consider it one of Wael's mysteries."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Wael is the god of secrets. If I told you that, I'd cheapen it, wouldn't I?" She cackles. "It's a parable. The kind that nourishes the inquisitive mind and poisons the foolish."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Grimda's impressive frown deepens. "Thank you for letting me know. I'll be sure to tuck that tome away from prying eyes... and see that this Nedyn never sets foot in here again.

      <DefaultText>Her cackle is little more than a rattling cough. "Even if I weren't schooled in secrets and mysteries, I'd know you for a liar. That much isn't a secret, I'm afraid."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Her gnarled hand shakes as she points at you. "You're every bit as wily as those thieves. I should have known better than to trust you."

Her trembling finger moves to the door. "Now get out."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>155</ID>
      <DefaultText>She gives you a long, stern look. "I'd call anyone else a liar with a story like that. But coming from you..." She squints behind her thick spectacles. "There is a certain logic, after all.

"And if you've served Wael, then you've served me, too."</DefaultText>

      <ID>159</ID>
      <DefaultText>She squints at you behind her thick spectacles. After several seconds of silence, she cackles. 

"Decades of service, and Wael is still a mystery even to me. But I see your point. You've aided the Obscured faithfully."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>162</ID>
      <DefaultText>Her scowl deepens. "It is not mere utility that makes the scroll valuable. Wael's truth is that it is the nature of kith to covet secrets. Either you are a fool, or you think me one."</DefaultText>

      <ID>165</ID>
      <DefaultText>Her smile reveals a row of crooked teeth. "That's the rub, isn't it? Wael is the god of things hidden and revealed. The more of the Hundred Visions one sees, the more one has yet to discover."

"Though we often call Wael 'He Who Sees and Is Not Seen,' it is neither male nor female. To assign any definitive characteristic to Wael is to miss another essential part of its divinity."</DefaultText>
