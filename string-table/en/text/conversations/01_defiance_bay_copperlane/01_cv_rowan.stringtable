      <DefaultText>Rowan's arms are crossed, and his mouth is set in a grim frown as he watches the gathered protesters. He looks ready for a fight.

He sizes you up. "New in town, eh? You've picked an interesting time to visit Defiance Bay. All these refugees fleeing the frontier and finding the Legacy's no better here."

"It's the animancers, Magran scorch 'em, and they nest in this city like rats. You mark my words, though, us Dozens are gonna put a stop to it."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He gestures at the crowd, which buzzes with angry chatter. "Trying to get folk to see reason. We're in the midst of a crisis, and instead of purging the nefarious forces from our city, the duc is granting animancers dangerous liberties."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He taps his chest. "We're an organization of interested citizens who want to free Defiance Bay from the dangerous influence of animancers and the tyranny of the aristocrats who support them.

"We also consider ourselves a militia of sorts, seeing as the Crucible Knights are little more than a flock of preening nobles-in-training these days."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"It's the study and manipulation of essence, which any sane person'll tell you is the purview of the gods. The Aedyrans at least had the sense to outlaw it, which is the only good thing you can say about them.

"It's not like magic, chanting, or the soul readings those ciphers do. It's been around since ancient Engwithan times, which is why you'll see animancers tinkering with old Engwithan artifacts."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"These days, we're a major port receiving trade and visitors from all over the world. But we - some of us, anyway - strive to hold on to the pioneering spirit that earned us our freedom a century and a half ago.

"The city is divided into five districts: Copperlane, First Fires, Ondra's Gift, Brackenbury, and Heritage Hill." He ticks each off on a calloused finger.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"This here is Copperlane." He taps a scuffed boot on the cobblestones. "It's primarily a market district, but you've also got the expedition hall directly north of here, where you can join treks into the wilds. That's also where my fellow Dozens martyrs and I tend to meet up with other concerned citizens."

He points to a long, domed building west and north of your position. "And that's the Hall of Revealed Mysteries. Eerie place, you ask me, but they've got the biggest library in the Dyrwood."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>A noise of disgust rattles in his throat. "The nobility that didn't sail back to Aedyr stayed there. Most of the families there trace their lineage back to old imperial times."

"Other than a lot of has-been nobility, you've got Hadret House, where Lady Webb and her spies operate, and Brackenbury Sanitarium, the main cesspit of animancy in the city." He spits on the cobblestones.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"That's where the revolution started. Hence the name. These days it's overrun with politicians and panderers, but we'll take it back someday.

"That's where you'll find the Ducal Palace, the Vailian embassy, and Crucible Keep." He shakes his head. "The Crucible Knights were the original freedom fighters in Defiance Bay, but now they're just strutting peacocks with their eyes on fancy titles and their heads up their asses.

"There's an old temple of Woedica there, too. We keep it real nice for her." He winks.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Got the name because it was a wetland that was drained back in the imperial days. Now, it's a seedy district populated by sailors, common folk, and more than a few thugs, but it's a fun place, too, if you know where to look."

He winks and elbows you. "Look for a place called the Salty Mast when you're there. Other than that it's mostly warehouses and abandoned homes."</DefaultText>

      <ID>25</ID>
      <DefaultText>He shivers. "It used to be one of the more prestigious districts in the city. Heroes of the revolution claimed plots up there, next to an ancient Engwithan tower and the city cemetery. Had the best views in Defiance Bay. Attracts richer types these days. Lotta animancy patrons." He spits.

He glances at the crowd and lowers his voice. "You wouldn't have heard, but something happened over there a couple months ago. The authorities sealed it off and they're keeping their mouths shut, but mark my words, animancy's to blame."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He gets a mischievous gleam in his eye. "Aye, I bet they don't teach about the colony that trounced Hadret's Handmaiden back in good old Aedyr, do they?"

"This is the capital of the Free Palatinate of the Dyrwood. We started out as the capital of an Aedyran colony, but we booted the Flaccid Scepter from these lands one hundred fifty years ago."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>His eyes gleam. "And we're always looking to expand. The more people see things our way, the better for the state of the country.

"You have any interest in hearing more, stop by Admeth's Den sometime - the expedition hall. Lotta free thinkers in there, can set straight all the nonsense the nobles and the animancers want you to believe. Might even be some paid work there for motivated types."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Kana laughs. "'Eerie' indeed. It might be less so if more kith stepped inside. Perhaps we ought to visit, [Player Name], and see just what mysteries are revealed." </DefaultText>
