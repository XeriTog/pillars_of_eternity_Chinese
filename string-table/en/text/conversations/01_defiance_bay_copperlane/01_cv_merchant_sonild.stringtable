      <DefaultText>The woman looks up from polishing a dagger. "Haven't seen you before. You headed out with an expedition company?" She raises an eyebrow. "Or are you betting on one?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She leans on the countertop and drums her fingers. "Oh, a few years. I got in the minute the last merchant cleared out." She nods toward the main area of the hall. "They've got new expeditions venturing out every week, so this is a great place to do business."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Headed out on an expedition? Look, seeing as you're in so well with the Dozens, I've got a special price for you on my stock. Care to take a look?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I'm afraid not. See, the Dozens only do business with me so long as I only do business with them. And they're good customers." 

She jerks her thumb at the door. "But if you get on Osric's good side, he could make an exception for you. He's probably training some of the new recruits right now."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"And the Dozens make loyal friends - and loyal customers - so long as you stick by them." 

She taps the counter. "The vendor who was here before me, they ran him out when he sold his best helms to a pair of Crucible Knights. I've been careful not to make the same mistake."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"They're groups of adventurers that venture into the wilderness. More than a few of them try their luck scouring the ruins. Most of them come back empty-handed - if they come back at all."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Betting on them is almost as risky as actually going. But that's how the expeditions get funded, and every once in a while, one of the adventuring companies will strike it big and make a fortune for their backers."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"What a mess outside." She shakes her head. "Still, I can't pretend it isn't good for business."</DefaultText>
