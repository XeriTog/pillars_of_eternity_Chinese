      <DefaultText>The woman barely glances up from the tomes on the table as you approach. "You're welcome to browse the stacks, but mind that you keep your voice down. This is still a temple, after all, and Grimda doesn't tolerate disorder."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Her eyes grow wide and round. "That's because it is! Wael is the god of mysteries and answers, encryption and decryption, concealment and revelation." 

She raises her hands to the rows of shelves. "Its guidance comes from the understanding of the unknown and the protection of hidden knowledge. The Hall of Revealed Mysteries was built to celebrate that."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She sighs and rolls her eyes. "Yes, it is a library of sorts. Temples dedicated to Wael tend to hold vast stores of knowledge. We use that knowledge to unravel and preserve the mysteries of the world."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She throws her broad shoulders back. "I am a scrivener and a devotee of Wael. It's my duty to look after our records and resources." Her chest swells with pride. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Fexa squints. "Just who do you think you are? Even I can't enter the Elder Archives without Grimda's approval."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Fexa frowns and raises her chin. "Your considerable prestige notwithstanding, no one gets into the Elder Archives without Grimda's permission." She deflates. "Even I'm not allowed inside."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Fexa shifts her weight. "I'd really like to let you in, but it's not up to me. Grimda's the only one who can grant permission, and she's rather strict with it. I hope you understand. Speaking as a fellow disciple."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Fexa speaks reverently. "Why, she's the High Archivist. She's one of the most accomplished scholars alive today. Nothing goes on here without her knowing about it. Almost nothing, anyway." She scratches behind her ear.

"You should probably tread lightly around her today."</DefaultText>
