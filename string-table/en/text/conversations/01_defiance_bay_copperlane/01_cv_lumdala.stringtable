      <DefaultText>The statuesque woman has a gaze that could cut stone. She turns her chiseled cheekbones to the sky and favors you with a look of acknowledgment. Her eyes shimmer under silvered eye shadow and a razor-precise line of kohl. Before you can speak, she throws her hand up in dramatic fashion. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"That depends entirely on the demands of the role." She lays a slender hand on her chest. "I am the Pallid Knight, the Widow of the Wood, and the warrior queen Mocga, all at different times. To live a different life each day is a glorious thing indeed, my friend."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Lumdala lets out a big laugh. "That drunk in Ondra's Gift? Men flatter themselves when it comes to the attentions of a beautiful woman. The Pallid Knight herself could waltz into that bar and he'd believe she was there to sit on his lap and listen to bawdy stories."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"And the facts are that one of us stinks of cheap ale and desperation while the other has a long and illustrious career." She tilts her head toward you. "Consider well which is a more credible source."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Her nose wrinkles. "Nothing to gain but a little tavern hall admiration. The men there compete with tales of conquests they can only dream of. But you clearly found his performance convincing enough."</DefaultText>

      <ID>47</ID>
      <DefaultText>She narrows her silvered eyes. "I'm not sure who this 'Kendal' is or why you would malign our talent, but rest assured that we have a process for evoking a satisfying performance from even the most inexperienced players."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Maybe, but what should I know about it? My work requires great focus and attention." She flicks her fingertips in frustration. "I don't have time to coach every young amateur who joins our troupe for a week."</DefaultText>
