      <DefaultText>An orlan man relaxes with his feet propped on the table. Patches of dark brown skin peek out from under a full mane of blue-green hair. He and the orlan woman with him exchange laughs and comments with the trio at a nearby table, and he spins a dagger in his hand. 

His hazel eyes watch you. "You look like you've seen a night or two in the wilds. Joining us for a drink?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He displays the blade on a flat palm. "I did, and a fine piece it is. I don't know of any more circulating in the city. Outside the steel in the Crucible Keep, of course."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He turns the blade in the light, admiring it. "Seeing as how there's a sudden demand for this, one hundred pands seems fair."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Demand isn't as high as you think. Chances are good that dagger was stolen or looted off of one of the Knights. In that case, I'm probably doing you a favor."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He frowns. "Can't be too careful around the authorities these days, especially as an orlan. Fine, I'll sell it, but not for less than fifty. I'm getting my money back at the very least."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"We were part of separate expedition teams, but we both suffered losses and decided to band together."

      <DefaultText>He looks from the dagger to you and back again. "He... oh, fine. But I won't take less than I paid for it." He pounds the table with a fist. "I knew fifty pands sounded too good to be true. "</DefaultText>
