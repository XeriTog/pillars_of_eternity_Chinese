      <DefaultText>A man paces angrily in front of a wrecked animal pen, his sun-weathered face twisted with ire. He's so wrapped up in his fury that he doesn't seem to notice you.

      <DefaultText>"An ogre moved into the area not long ago. Folk had been seeing glimpses and tracks out in the wood, but it seemed to be staying away from town. Or so we all thought until it made off with my pigs. Now, everyone's afraid it's going to develop a taste for kith. If it hasn't already."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He balls his hands into two shaking fists. His face starts to redden. "But... that's... son of an orlan whore! That thing devoured my entire herd! I wanted it dead, and I wanted to mount its head on a pike!"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He slaps his thigh and hoots. "Blazes! That thing's even uglier than I thought! And look at the size of it..." He squints, open-mouthed, into the ogre's dead eyes.

      <DefaultText>"And I seduced every women in Ondra's Gift and didn't get the pox." He shakes his head and holds up a dirt-streaked hand. "As much as I'd love to believe that monster's dead, I want proof. I won't part with old Lead Spitter for nothing."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He spins to face you, his cheeks puffed up and red. "Why, I'll-"

He takes a deep breath and lets it out slowly. "Not your fault. I'm sorry. Temper's getting the better of me again. But with all but a few of my runts gone, my pen destroyed..." The color rises in his face again. "What am I supposed to do?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I know it's too late to get my pigs back. But it'd set my mind at ease to see that thing's head shorn from its neck.

      <DefaultText>He takes another long, deep breath. "You're right. Here, take this for your troubles. I should look on the bright side. The ogre's gone, and I can start rebuilding my herd."

      <DefaultText>He takes one of the pigs and gives it a quick examination. "This runt's still looking too small. I don't expect to get any good litters out of it, and I'd just as soon not have it weaken the rest of my stock. Why don't you take it? Gives me one less mouth to feed, anyway."

      <DefaultText>His mouth falls open. "You... you'd do that for me? I don't know what to say." He snaps his fingers. "Wait right there."

He darts into the house and returns with a blunderbuss in his hands. "I call it the Lead Spitter. It belonged to my father and served me in the Saint's War. It's old but sturdy, and it packs a real punch. Should be more useful to someone like yourself these days."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He takes the head in both arms, heedless of the stinking drizzle of blood that fouls his clothes. "I've got big plans for this. You wait right here."

He disappears into the house and returns with a blunderbuss in his hands. "I call it the Lead Spitter. It belonged to my father and served me in the Saint's War.

      <DefaultText>He reddens again, this time with embarrassment. "That's mighty thoughtful of you. It'll be another six months before any of these can breed anyway." He crosses his arms and looks at the piglets. "Although..."</DefaultText>
