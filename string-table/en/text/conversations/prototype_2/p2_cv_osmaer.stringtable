      <DefaultText>"Used to be a castle here. Built by some family of Aedyran thayns back when the Empire first came. Only one tower's still standing, and that's part of Trygil's shop now.

      <DefaultText>"Not many anymore. Hard to keep people around when everyone here's birthing Hollowborn.

"But we got a few who stick around and do business. Trygil's the leather currier, Hendyna crafts potions, and Winfrith trades in general goods. Rumbald's a pig farmer... or was, anyway."</DefaultText>

      <ID>27</ID>
      <DefaultText>"He's a currier. Treats leather and makes armor and a few other goods with it. Problem is, the smell of tallow and deer shit tends to put people off their food, and his shop's right next door."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He frowns and shrugs. "His lordship says she up and went missing the other day." He wipes a tankard with his ragged towel, twisting it with swift, jerking motions.

      <DefaultText>He leans on the bar and sighs. "That girl, Aelys... she was looking to disappear. You should've seen her, watching the door like a sheep at slaughter. All the same, she didn't hardly speak to no one. Only folk I seen her talk to's Trygil."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He nods at the east window. "His shop's by the broken tower. Bit of a hothead, that one. My advice is to let the matter drop. Like I say, it don't profit to dig around in other people's business."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The innkeeper digs inside a mug with a dirty rag. His eyes under his thick brows are tired but watchful. He gives you a quick nod as you approach the bar. "Don't see many travelers these days. Somethin' I can do for you?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He scowls at you. "Put them coppers away. My pay come from an honest day's work. Enough for me and should be enough for anyone. But you're just like that lord, rattling your purse like it's fit to buy the leave of gods and kith..."</DefaultText>

      <ID>72</ID>
      <DefaultText>"What I know is it's best avoided. It don't serve to anger the Glanfathans by stomping around their sacred grounds. If you've gotta satisfy your curiosity, talk to Beodmar. He's in the temple to the northwest."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"'Course not, why would they come here? We got bandits on the road and an ogre in the forest, as that yapping fool Rumbald'll tell you. Worse yet, hasn't been a healthy child born here in over a year.

"Most kith that come here is just passing through."</DefaultText>
