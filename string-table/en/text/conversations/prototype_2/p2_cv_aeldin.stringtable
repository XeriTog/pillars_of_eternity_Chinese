      <DefaultText>A sturdy, broad-shouldered man wipes his hands on his slacks. He reeks of the same foul compound wafting from the vats, and his arms are stained with dye.

      <DefaultText>He shrugs. "Only that her father's men have been banging down doors and stirring up trouble looking for her. I never met her, myself."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He watches you and smiles slowly. "He doesn't miss much.

      <ID>17</ID>
      <DefaultText>He folds his arms, the smell of tallow and animal dung wafting off of him. "Did she, now? And what else did she say?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Her father's dragged her out here to get hitched to some backwoods noble. She wanted an escape, all right... and I was happy to give it to her."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"We snuck across the river a few nights ago for some private time. Come to find out, we weren't exactly alone. An ogre, taller than Winfrith's tales, sprung out of the forest, and we were so lost in the heat of the moment, we didn't notice it until it was upon us."</DefaultText>

      <ID>32</ID>
      <DefaultText>He measures you with his gaze. "She could still be alive. I'm in no shape to go after her, but that Harond looks like he'd have coppers to spare for anyone who found her."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>33</ID>
      <DefaultText>He scratches his cheek with fingers stained red and yellow. "Others around here have seen the ogre east of town. Took most of Rumbald's pigs just the other day. If someone were to find it, there'd be a lot of grateful people in Dyrford."</DefaultText>

      <ID>37</ID>
      <DefaultText>He balks. "Kor- the ogre? That thing has a name?" He guffaws. "I don't know what's funnier. That you took the monster at its word or that you came back to tell me about it." He hefts his axe. "Either way, I've heard enough."</DefaultText>

      <ID>40</ID>
      <DefaultText>"He's hardly talked about anything else since those pigs of his went missing. The whole town's been worried about that monster. People are starting to see shapes in their windows at night, hearing its growl in the snoring of their mates. It would put a lot of minds at ease if someone got rid of it."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />

    <Entry>
      <ID>41</ID>
      <DefaultText>His grin widens. "That's one way of putting it."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>44</ID>
      <DefaultText>"And you suppose I should have run after the ogre with nothing but my own waning scepter to attack it? A lot of good that would have done us both."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Don't take this the wrong way, but this shop smells like an outhouse. Am I really to believe that a lord's daughter snuck into the woods with you?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I was wondering what had happened to my... colleague. Thanks for finding that - you've saved me a lot of trouble."

He raises his axe.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>His eyes narrow. "As I was saying, the ogre vanished with her. Probably took her to its lair, wherever that is."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I don't repeat myself, not for you and not for some noble's toadies, either."

    <Entry>
      <ID>75</ID>
      <DefaultText>He scrapes at red pigment under his fingernails. "I sometimes venture into the wilderness. Collecting ingredients for my dyes, mind you. I've seen tracks east of here, near the river, that couldn't have been anything else."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"It's collapsed. Nothing." He rolls his eyes and shrugs. "A few hides on stretching racks and the tallow-stench Dengler's always grumbling about. The rest of the keep's dust, just like the fool lady thaynu who tried to hold it. There's a bard at the inn who'll tell you the whole blazing story if you want to hear it."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>A sturdy, broad-shouldered man wipes his hands on his slacks. He reeks of the same foul compound wafting from the vats, and his arms are stained with dye.

He looks at your calloused hands and nods approvingly. "Fellow tradesman, eh? I hate to say it, but you won't find much work here."</DefaultText>
