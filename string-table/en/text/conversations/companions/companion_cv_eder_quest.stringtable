      <DefaultText>"Nah, it's- well it's kinda embarrassing now. I just got a dumb idea in my head is all. Don't know why I thought it'd work.

      <DefaultText>He sighs. "All right. Guess fair's fair, and you did bring me to see him.

"Those rumors back in Gilded Vale about my brother, Woden. About how he'd turned against us and fought for Waidwen. Been on my mind for some time now."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I thought... maybe this old Watcher would know how my brother died, so I could see if it was true. Like he could- I dunno, read it in my soul or something. Use our connection.

      <DefaultText>"Thing about Woden was, he always knew what was right, and that's what he'd do. One day he set out to fight for Dyrwood against a man claiming to be our god. So I knew that's what I had to do too. It was right.

"Hearing claims that he died fighting for Readceras, that got me worried. Not that he'd chosen the wrong side, but that I had. Didn't seem right, what Waidwen had in store, but if he really was Eothas..." He shakes his head.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Ed&#233;r thinks a moment, his lips twisted to one side. He raises his eyebrows. "If there was anything written down about it, they'd have it in Defiance Bay. They got an archive at the palace."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"You've done a lot for me already, but if you could see fit to pay that archive a visit with me, well... you know.

      <DefaultText>"This is the place. My big brother's last battle."

Ed&#233;r scans the lush landscape before you in all directions. He presses his lips together.

"Wish I could tell you what we're looking for."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You close your hand around it and pull it from the wet earth. 

The object is a steel, semicircular frame, about the size of your fist. At even points around the semicircle, jagged points jut out like tongues of flame, the rays of a rising sun.

At the sun's center is the carved silhouette of a vorlas plant.

      <DefaultText>"I've seen these before. They top the standards of Readceras. Or did when Waidwen was alive."

He takes it from you and looks it over, flipping it over and over in his hand. "Well it's something. Just not sure what it gets me."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He shrugs. "It's a thought. Lotta people would've touched this. Standard Bearer's a position of honor in most places, but the Readcerans actually took to fighting for it, what I heard. Serious bunch."

"It's not a lot to hang hopes on, but hey, we were lucky to find anything at all."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You take the steel sun in one hand, and clasp Ed&#233;r's hand with the other, ignoring his uncertain glance.</DefaultText>

      <ID>47</ID>
      <DefaultText>One voice stands out amidst the din, brassy and earnest, a shade brighter than Ed&#233;r's, but unmistakably of the same construction.

You have no image of its owner, but his journey is imprinted within the points and curves of the steel sun, and in your mind it opens before you as a path stretching both southward to Gilded Vale and northward over the uneven terrain that joins the Dyrwood to Readceras.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>53</ID>
      <DefaultText>You trace the path back to its origin, far back as you can find, gliding over plains and hillsides, to a one-room home in Gilded Vale with a thatched roof and a dirt floor. The path is faint here, its distance in time rendering images blurry and details scarce.

From Gilded Vale it follows a road toward Madhmr Bridge, reaching the gates of Defiance Bay before diverting abruptly, cutting northward in a beeline for Readceras.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>54</ID>
      <DefaultText>The path leads to a Readceran city, regal and austere in the Aedyre imperial style. It winds through streets and climbs a grand set of stairs into a stately building, passing through pointed archways into what appears to be a throne room.

Upon the throne sits a man whose head is pure, blinding light, and as its gaze turns to you, the light drowns out all else. Its voice carries the force of thunder, but its words are impossible to make out in the imprint, echoes of echoes.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>55</ID>
      <DefaultText>The voice and light fade, and the path bends backward, carrying you along to a barracks, then back southward, marching into Dyrwood and skirmishing along the way.</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>56</ID>
      <DefaultText>Upon one battlefield the imprint is vivid, and you see a Readceran standard topped with a steel sun, clutched in the hands of a fallen soldier.

You see a young man in Readceran armor with Ed&#233;r's straw-colored hair race toward the standard and lift it, the path you've been following clear to see beneath his feet, and as his hand brushes the steel tip you can hear his thoughts racing in a blur and they are of his god and his country and a brother he hopes is far away from this place.</DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>57</ID>
      <DefaultText>In an instant, the thoughts are gone as well as the man, and the standard is passed to another soldier. You pick the path up again as it meanders south and disintegrates in the shadow of Cl&#238;aban Rilag.

You open your eyes.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Ed&#233;r's eyes widen. "What'd he talk about with Waidwen?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Figured that. Woden and me had heard enough stories from his uprising to know it wasn't just some tall tale. Doesn't mean he was Eothas. Could've been some wizard's trick.

"It's what they talked about that's important. What'd they say?"</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>66</ID>
      <DefaultText>"No. That doesn't make sense. He had no reason to take Waidwen at his word.

      <ID>67</ID>
      <DefaultText>Ed&#233;r frowns. "That's not funny. Come on. That metal sun, my brother touched it. You saw where he went. Now what'd he talk about with Waidwen? Why'd my brother fight for Readceras?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Ed&#233;r's mouth hangs open and his eyes glaze, his forehead creased between his eyebrows. He rakes his teeth over his lower lip.

His voice is barely a whisper.

      <DefaultText>"I don't think we will." A new look has come over Ed&#233;r, lifeless and dull as ash.

"What would we do? Look for more war relics? We were lucky to find this one.

"The soldiers that fought with him are long dead. The battle was a massacre. And whatever Eothas knows, he's not talking to anyone."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He nods slowly, staring into space. A new look has come over him, lifeless and dull as ash.

    <Entry>
      <ID>85</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Foolish of course. Why should I get answers? There's a world of Eothasians out there, don't know if their god's been blown up.

      <DefaultText>Ed&#233;r blinks, considering.
