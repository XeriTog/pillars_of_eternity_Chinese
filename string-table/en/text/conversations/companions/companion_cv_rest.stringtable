      <DefaultText>You feel a presence hovering nearby. When you turn, you see the Grieving Mother observing you. Concern crinkles the corners of her eyes and seeps into your mind. 

"You wear a caul of your own, Watcher. I see you shrouded by old lives and unanswered questions."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She closes her eyes, and you feel her energy directed inwards at you. She searches your mind, your memories, and parts of you that feel numb and still. She is as gentle as a mother with a newborn. 

Finally, she retreats. "I am sorry. Whatever secrets your soul hides are not present in your mind."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"This is why we journey together. That one may draw strength from many, and that much may be mended by the... purpose of one."

As she peers at you, her brow seems creased with a new kind of anxiety. "Your obscure past... does it trouble you?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You've just begun to stretch and soothe the aches from your body when you feel Aloth over your shoulder. He looks away quickly when you notice him, kneading his hands into squirming fists.

"I'm sorry, [Player Name], I didn't mean to sneak up on you. I just, well, you seem... preoccupied."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I suppose I've just noticed you acting a little... unusual lately." He seems to be wringing each bead of sweat from his fingers. "Talking to people who aren't there, remembering flashbacks of your previous life... I just want to make sure you're doing all right." He stares at a spot on the ground.</DefaultText>

      <ID>25</ID>
      <DefaultText>He smiles painfully. "You know me too well.

"But it does seem that our afflictions differ. Iselmyr asserts herself now and then, but that's nothing new. You, on the other hand..." He tugs a lock of hair. "You seem to be getting worse."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Sagani saunters over to you, stretching her legs. She holds a pouch of deer jerky in one hand, and she offers it as she takes a seat across from you. Itumaak looks on hungrily.

"Long day." She bends one arm behind her head, reaching until you hear a pop. "Just wanted to see how you're holding up. You seem to have a lot of long nights."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She folds her arms over her knees. "Look, it's been a while since I had a hunting party, but we're in this together now. And even if we're hunting for different things, we're still hunting together."

She takes a hunk of dried meat from her pouch and bites a long strip from it. Itumaak licks his lips, and she tosses him the rest.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You wake to the sensation of being shaken, and you open your eyes to see Ed&#233;r standing over you, his hand jostling your shoulder. He looks concerned.

Your eyes are heavy and your vision blurred, the vague unease of unremembered nightmares clouding your thoughts. You are not sure you slept at all the previous night.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Hey. Hey! You're awake? Good."

He exhales. "You were- you were kinda thrashing around, eyes rolled back in your head. And you were shaking.

"Been trying to snap you out of it for a long time now. Thought I was gonna have to get a bucket of cold water."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"It's the Watcher thing, then. I'm sure it just takes some time to adjust is all." His smile is not one of a man convinced by his own words.

"I'll try to let it sort itself out. But you'd better wake up faster next time. Trust me, you don't want that bucket of cold water."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Half-asleep, a tide of deafening whispers assails you, chipping away at your senses, at your mind's understanding of itself. Their roar is louder with each passing night, their attacks more brazen, less confined to your subconscious.

A familiar voice fights its way through the din, calling out to you.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Hey! Hey!" Ed&#233;r rolls his eyes, relieved to see you looking back at him.

He shakes his head. "You've gotta stop it with that. I just about punched you to snap you out of it. You were saying things but they weren't any words I ever heard. And you were shaking so hard I thought you'd crack your spine."</DefaultText>
