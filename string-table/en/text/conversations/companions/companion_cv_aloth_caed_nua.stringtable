      <DefaultText>He sighs. "I also have an Awakened soul. But, unlike yours, mine is a presence that shares my senses and my skin, making herself manifest at the most unwelcome times."</DefaultText>

      <ID>37</ID>
      <DefaultText>He closes his eyes and grits his teeth. His lips quiver and twitch with the vestiges of some internal debate. 

Several seconds later, he opens his eyes again. They're watery and bloodshot.</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>38</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I'm sorry." He shakes his head. "I've tried to learn to control Iselmyr. I've gotten stronger, but so has she."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>41</ID>
      <DefaultText>He shakes his head. "I learned to keep her a secret a very long time ago. Those with Awakened souls are shunned. Mistrusted. And after your experience with Maerwald, I'm certain you can see why." He looks up at you. "You need to be careful, [Player Name]."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>43</ID>
      <DefaultText>He grimaces, running his hands through his hair. "I have none of her memories - Berath spared me that much. But her coarse manners and intolerable Hylspeak suggest a provincial from a very, very long time ago."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"She tends to surface a hair's breadth from conflict - when the fuse has burned down and teeth are on edge. And when she shows up, she doesn't stop to gauge a situation, she just... acts."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I have not been entirely honest about my motives for traveling with you up to this point.

"When I finished my training in Aedyr, I was introduced to an organization. All I knew was that they were opposed to the unchecked spread of animancy and that they could guarantee me postings far away from the Cythwood, my father, and his erl. At that time, it was enough."</DefaultText>
