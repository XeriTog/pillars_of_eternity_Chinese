      <DefaultText>As you reach the edge of the bluff, you recognize the exact location from your vision of Persoq. He was here not long ago.

Sagani stands alert, the adra statuette in one hand while she scans the cliff.

You close your eyes, feeling the ether for some trace of Persoq's presence. The darkness behind your eyelids takes shape.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You feel Persoq running through the forest this time, hurtling and dashing around rocks and trees. The scenery whizzes by too fast - you can't make out the details between the blurred greenery.

Something looms out of the trees ahead of you. Persoq finally stops in front of an adra arch.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"That depends on who you ask." She kicks a pebble over the cliff and watches it plummet.

"I talked to everyone in Massuk before I left. I heard he was a strong leader, a dependable builder, a caring grandfather, a wise elder, a generous neighbor, a cunning negotiator..." She shrugs.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"The odd thing is, many in Massuk weren't much older than me when Persoq passed. And yet everyone wanted to make sure he heard about something in particular - our trade with the aumaua, our successful hunts, peace with neighboring villages."

She kicks another pebble over the edge. Itumaak follows its arc, his ears forward.</DefaultText>

      <ID>33</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I've wondered about that. Most of his daughters and nieces are too old for a journey like this. And as busy as he was, his grandchildren didn't know him all that well.

"Besides, that's never been the purpose of these journeys. Whoever he is now, he probably won't remember his family back in Naasitaq. This is about the legacy he left the village."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"It just seems odd that so few of us remember him beyond the things he did for the village. 

"Most of his family members - the ones who knew him - are in their twilight years now. And Persoq was too busy to spend much time with his younger relatives."

Itumaak yawns and impatiently nuzzles her hand.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The adra arch looms in front of you, just as you saw it through Persoq's eyes. Sagani turns, watching the trees for movement.

As the arch's shadow falls over you, the wooded shore fades into a different scene.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You're standing in another forest. Blackened, bare trunks claw their way out of the soil and keep a solemn vigil over the young trees and tender shrubs. 

You move slowly through the woods and the ruins scattered throughout them. Stone pillars and broken arches show the bones of some destroyed building.

Between and amidst it all are elves and orlans, their faces painted and their bows drawn.</DefaultText>

"Sounds like you're describing the desolate stretch in the mountain slopes north of Twin Elms - site of an old battle from the War of Black Trees."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The stunted, charred trunks look like the aftermath of the War of Black Trees. Battles were fought all over the Dyrwood and Eir Glanfath, and many of the deadliest fronts developed along the borders and behind major Glanfathan settlements.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"It's been hard to see a purpose behind the last five years. But lately I've started to realize just how much Persoq shaped our village. How his efforts and sacrifices added up, made us stronger.

"Bringing his blessing back to Massuk will strengthen us and draw us even closer together. And I'm proud to know that I'll be the one returning with it."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"It's funny what you recall after being away for so long. I remember the shape of my hunting trails more clearly than the faces of Kallu and our children. 

"I thought that was just what it meant to take care of them - spending nights camped on the caribou routes instead of at our hearth. But thinking about Persoq and how he lived, I'm not so sure. And perhaps that's why the gods gave me the little tooth - to help me see it."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"After five years, I'm not sure what the point of this is. Persoq has moved on. And while I'm out here, everyone in Massuk is carrying on as normal.

"And that'll be the case whether I come back having found Persoq or die out here. To be honest, I'm not sure what that means for me."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You come upon a clearing and see a group of Glanfathans standing in a circle. Sagani glances from the adra statuette to the hunters, looking for a connection.

      <DefaultText>They step aside and turn to you, and as they do, you see something on the ground behind them.

Lying amidst the ferns is a white stag. Dark blood mars its brilliant coat, and its sides tremble with quick, shallow breaths.

You feel a presence in the beast, something ancient and familiar. Before you can speak...</DefaultText>
