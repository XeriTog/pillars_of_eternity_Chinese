      <DefaultText>"It's been a long hunt." She adjusts the bow hung over her shoulder. "A long time away from my family. Before, I'd crossed the tundra of Naasitaq following caribou herds. I didn't want to leave Kallu and our children, but I was eager to visit lands my people rarely do. 

"But five years without finding him." She scratches at a callus on her middle finger. "It's like two hours of necking. I'm ready to be done with it."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Soul-recovery is an old village tradition. We call it the Tarneq-Ilitsaak." She sighs. "Once in a generation, we seek the soul of a much-respected - and long-dead - village elder. We tell him what's changed in the village. How people remember him.

"The only other Tarneq-Ilitsaak during my lifetime happened when I was a girl, not long after Persoq died. We feasted on blubber and fermented milk for a week, and we honored the chosen huntress as a hero."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Then she left, and we returned to our duties. We still sang her name to the skies during festival season, but we otherwise didn't speak of her."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"It's not being forgotten by my village that troubles me. But... sometimes I wonder how my husband and children remember me. If they think of me often."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She sighs. "Still, there's no point in dwelling on it. More often, I find myself wondering whether Persoq will remember us."

She gives you a sidelong glance. "You... claim to see souls. What do you think? Do you remember your past lives?"</DefaultText>

      <ID>18</ID>
      <DefaultText>She sits back. "I don't envy you. Guess I'm lucky I only have to worry about someone else's past life."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>19</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Uncomfortable. I'd just as soon not remember any of it."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Frustrating. I only wish I knew more."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The stripe of paint across her eyes widens. "Good things, I hope. Maybe Persoq'll be the same way. Would make my job of telling him about the village a lot easier."</DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>25</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I figured. Most people don't anyway. I suppose that's why I'm supposed to remind Persoq of what he left behind in our village."</DefaultText>

      <ID>26</ID>
      <DefaultText>"What would you tell him about your village?"</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>27</ID>
      <DefaultText>She brushes a braid behind her shoulder. "Massuk is probably much the same as it was a hundred years ago. We live between tundra and frozen forests, and the land takes as much as it gives. But our hardships bring us together.

"And the elders truly unite us. They keep the stories of past generations, and they guide us from season to season, through good years and lean."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Itumaak brushes against her hip, and she scratches his head.

"Recently, there've been a lot of good years. My aunts say we've had fewer clashes with neighboring villages thanks to the hunting territories that Persoq helped establish."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"In bad years, we rely on trade with the merchants that pass our shores. We exchange walrus tusks and seal pelts for grains that last us the hard winters. 

"Persoq brokered a lot of those agreements, too." She holds up the bear figurine. "He got this from one of the aumaua ships that used to trade with us."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She shoves the adra bear back into her caribou-skin pack. "That's what I'm supposed to remind him."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Her voice grows quiet. "As family." She shoves the adra bear back into her caribou-skin pack.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Sounds like you're on a hunt of your own, though. You feeling the thrill of the chase? Or ready for this to be over?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She rises and stretches, looking around. "We've got darkness on our side. Shall we move on?"</DefaultText>

      <ID>42</ID>
      <DefaultText>She laughs and thumps her knee. "Just what I'd expect from a rugged outdoorsman. It's refreshing to travel with someone else who can appreciate the scent of a trail, that's for sure."</DefaultText>

      <ID>46</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I suppose that is what brought you to the Dyrwood in the first place, isn't it?"</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />

    <Entry>
      <ID>47</ID>
      <DefaultText>She nods. "I suppose you're used to a bit more comfort than this."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Does it matter? I don't have much of a choice in this, anyway."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>49</ID>
      <DefaultText>Her brow creases. "I know what you mean."</DefaultText>

      <ID>51</ID>
      <DefaultText>"It's the duty of an elder to lead according to the needs and wishes of the village." She shoves the adra bear back into her caribou-skin pack. "So, who knows?"</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>

    <Entry>
      <ID>54</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Then I won't pry. It's Persoq's past - and what he remembers about our village - that I should focus on, anyway."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I would like to believe it. And yet... sometimes days go by and I realize that they have not crossed my thoughts. Such days are rare, but they happen."

She looks away, tugging at the strap of her quiver. "It shames me to think of it, but more than that, it scares me."</DefaultText>
