      <DefaultText>"I think, deep down, I'd always hoped to find a solution elsewhere. When I was a child, I always thought my mother would come home with a mysterious cure. Or that my father, without knowing it, could somehow send her away just as he'd called her forth.

      <DefaultText>He laughs humorlessly. "Over-starched tunics. Burnt toast. Rauatai sherry. Those are 'not that bad.' But having a stranger pop in and out of your head at will? It's unpleasant, I assure you."</DefaultText>

      <ID>41</ID>
      <DefaultText>He raises an eyebrow. "You don't think so, eh? It's a comfort to imagine that all we've gone through has been for something. But it leaves me wondering where we'll be - where everyone else will be - when we finally track down Thaos."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>A cautious, thoughtful look crosses his face. "That reminds me something else the delemgan said. About the gods not being real." He says it quietly, as if afraid someone might overhear him.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Yes, I suppose so. Still, I can't help but worry at the state we'd be in if that were somehow true. If there were no power guiding us in this life and shepherding us to the next."</DefaultText>

      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>60</ID>
      <DefaultText>He rolls his eyes. "Call me dramatic, but the existence or lack of powerful beings controlling our fates after we die seems worth the worry, no? Don't you wonder at the state we'd be in if there were no power guiding us in this life and shepherding us to the next?"</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>66</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Your whole life, you've been taking orders. If you can't assert your authority over her, you'll never have it anywhere else."</DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>68</ID>
      <DefaultText>He's quiet for several seconds. "I've always seen her as an adversary. You've shown me that, for all her flaws, she's been an ally, too. We want the same things even if we don't go about them the same way.

"I think it's time I stopped fighting her."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>69</ID>
      <DefaultText>He's quiet for several seconds. "I've been thinking about it a lot lately. About her recklessness, her unpredictability. And about how my own irresolution is to blame.

"I need to start taking control. And that begins here."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>70</ID>
      <DefaultText>He tucks his hair behind his ears and straightens his hood. "It's hard to be comfortable in your own skin when you're sharing it with someone else."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>71</ID>
      <DefaultText>He's quiet for several seconds. Finally, he nods. "It's strange, I've lived with her most of my life, and I've always seen her as an adversary. It should have occurred to me the day she stood up to my father... but there's something about being too close to a situation to see it clearly."

He smiles. "It will be a relief to stop fighting her."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>72</ID>
      <DefaultText>Even as he says it, something struggles within him. The muscles in his face twitch and his skin quivers. His eyes roll back in his skull, exposing slivers of white. Sweat beads and glistens on his forehead.

After several seconds, he sighs and looks back at you.

"That... wasn't as difficult as I expected."</DefaultText>

      <ID>74</ID>
      <DefaultText>Aloth's face is twisted with fury and despair. "We've been lied to... our whole lives, and many lives before that. And it's led us to put our faith in a pantheon of gods that never deserved it in the first place."</DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>83</ID>
      <DefaultText>His head jerks back. "I'm surprised to hear you say this. It seems that much harm comes from imposing authority where perhaps none is needed.

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>84</ID>
      <DefaultText>He scratches his chin, his eyes gazing at some far-off point in the darkened prison. "Indeed. And I fear what would become of the world if people lost that mooring. Even widespread belief in the gods seems like it's barely enough to correct our aimlessness and contain our depravity."</DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>85</ID>
      <DefaultText>He looks back at you out of the corners of his eyes. "I've also been thinking. There won't be much left of Thaos by the time you're done with him... if I know how you operate." One side of his mouth twitches in a grin. 

"That will leave the Leaden Key headless. Perhaps it's best it stays that way."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He scratches his chin, gazing at some far-off point in the darkened prison. "You're right. People would be better off finding direction on their own than following this farce. Besides, the gods haven't exactly done much to prevent us from slaughtering each other. If anything, they've only given us more pretenses for doing so."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />

    <Entry>
      <ID>88</ID>
      <DefaultText>His head jerks back. "How can you say that after all we've seen? Even with the idea that the gods are watching us and directing our reincarnations, it's a miracle that we haven't all killed each other already."</DefaultText>
