      <DefaultText>"She's a goddess, as fickle as they come... and with all the failings you'd expect of an empress and a whore." He frowns, scratches at his face. "Her clergy share the same failings.

"Too many eyes, too many wants, too much to hold on to... that's the failing of a god - more aspects than words to describe her like most of them." He snorts. "A god with many nations to oversee, only serves to spread herself too thin..."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Durance begins to count on his fingers, chanting it off. "War transforms, fire consumes, trials purify... 

"Warfare, fire, consuming, purification, and most of all, transforming. Trials as well, but all things are put to the test anyway - a trial can consume, purify, transform."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"They are all linked, although at its heart is the flame, and the flame is what matters, it is the... 'source of all things.' Guess they should have started with that, eh? Any fool around a campfire knows that."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Some. Shaped for hunt and war." He pauses, his finger scratching at a pox scar at his cheek. 

"Abydon, the Golem. Galawain and his beasts. The latter keeps us honest and awake..." Durance lets his free hand form a double-grip on his staff. "...the other makes the tools by which we punish those who are not."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Durance snorts. "Wouldn't have been surprised if you hadn't. More gods than weeds in a field, and those are only the ones of this lifetime. They come and go, but are always here at the same time."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Abydon... used to look human." Durance grunts. "Got killed, then built a new body for himself. 'Transformation,' with Magran's help. 

"Perhaps she needed her own blacksmith to tend the fires. If so, Abydon serves it." Durance frowns. "He's a weapon, a tool, not a god, in my mind."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"His... aspects are a confusing bunch, and considering he respects reversals of fortune, especially in beasts? Perhaps not so confusing. 

"No reason why Magran and he share a bed, in my eyes. Even if he does believe in the trial. A filthy orlan god, in many ways, howling and mewling perhaps like they do. They can keep their beasts, I'll take fire and weapons any day."</DefaultText>

      <ID>52</ID>
      <DefaultText>Durance glances at you, then snorts. "Ah... orlan defiance, now there's something to fear. 

"Lot of good that did you when the slaving was at its peak, and you were all footrugs and prone rugs for various shitheeled nobles." Durance sneers. "Those days may come again - after all, you deserved it."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />

    <Entry>
      <ID>56</ID>
      <DefaultText>Durance looks at you, surprised. "Too weak to defend yourselves. You were tested, still are, and you're lacking. Orlan, war isn't going to stop to wait for you to catch up."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>57</ID>
      <DefaultText>Durance shifts his weight, and his eyes narrow slightly. "You're welcome to try, and I'll clean my boots on you just as the nobles did. You're the only ones to blame... you were too weak to defend yourselves.

"You were tested, still are, and you're lacking." Durance shrugs. "Orlan, war isn't going to stop to wait for you to catch up."</DefaultText>

      <ID>58</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Ah, humans, there's an insult." Durance shifts his weight, and his eyes gleam. "Yet you were the ones under our shit-stained heels. At least we humans were allowed to walk on our legs, orlan... as for you, you only have yourself to blame... you were too weak to defend yourselves.

"You were tested, still are, and you're lacking." Durance shrugs. "Orlan, war isn't going to stop to wait for you to catch up."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>59</ID>
      <DefaultText>He frowns, as if thinking. "Now an orlan Watcher... maybe get enough of you, then you'll have a chance. But we'll see, won't we? At least I will... not sure if your eyes will, too busy looking outward, judging me for your own failings."</DefaultText>

      <ID>62</ID>
      <DefaultText>Durance laughs. "Be more of a question if a god has any allies." The mirth leaves his face, and he sneers. "Certainly not any friends. 

"But yes." His sneer dies, and you see his gaze become long. "There were enemies. Were."</DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>63</ID>
      <DefaultText>Durance laughs. "Before, when you asked about allies? Well, now... ally, enemy... that's a skin's edge of difference in history's eye." The mirth leaves his face, and he sneers. "But there were enemies. Were."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Eothas." Durance gives a cold grin, nods. "But we sorted that out. Then... Hylea, and her queen's crown of feathers and birds." He sneers. "Perhaps she claims to see the world from her perch... I hope she saw what happened to Eothas and if she dares to walk upon an earth where such fire runs."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>65</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Her temples are things of windows and twittering music. If a bird falls, know that it's a victory, seeing another set of darting eyes from that feathered bitch die is a pleasure to me."</DefaultText>

      <ID>67</ID>
      <DefaultText>"She and her clergy offer shelter to the Eothasians since his death, his humiliation. She's next for me."</DefaultText>

      <ID>68</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Oh, has my talk raised more questions?" He narrows his eyes for a moment, then grins. "A true surprise.

"Do I value her?" His face reddens, and his grin dies. A trickle of sweat forms from his forehead. "Why, I hold value in all whores - for a whore, their motivations are honest."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>69</ID>
      <DefaultText>"And if one such as I who truly seeks to embody trials and purification, one such as I who basks in war... why, if I do not even dare to take that fight to the principles of a goddess and her chosen fires..." He grins. "I would bleed to death on my own hypocrisy."</DefaultText>

      <ID>70</ID>
      <DefaultText>"So you are in conflict with Magran?"</DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>71</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Men fight. Women fight." He chuckles. "Sometimes, even with the same sex. If one isn't fighting, struggling, punishing, then what good are you?" He raps his staff to the ground. "It's uncomfortable enough that this rod isn't drawing blood and bruise right now."

Durance gives a strange smile. "But now... fighting a goddess, that's something one would be hard-pressed to call a true fight. But that's what makes one among the faithful - taking on those odds."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />

    <Entry>
      <ID>72</ID>
      <DefaultText>"But if you're in opposition to her, how do you draw power from her?"</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>73</ID>
      <DefaultText>Durance shrugs, but his face twists in a cruel sneer. "Eothas burned, yet his worshipers still suck power from his smoldering cock... beyond the spirit-twist of their lies and blasphemies."

He frowns. "If I give my goddess offense, then I serve her according to her aspects. And it may be that in giving such offense and receiving it, I may find deeper lessons."</DefaultText>

      <ID>74</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Durance did much the same in his travels, it was in defiance, the feeling that there is some other truth that is not found solely in staring into flames."</DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>76</ID>
      <DefaultText>"To hear some of the inner fires tell it around the Hearth and Bellows, even in the halls of Ashfall, you'd think that fire brought life to man. And that fire was Magran. Some of the older texts say she rubbed her hands together and they burst into flame..."

"...or another god shafted her like a poker."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />

    <Entry>
      <ID>77</ID>
      <DefaultText>"There are different perspectives on her, then?"</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>78</ID>
      <DefaultText>He grunts. "Mine is only one sight among many." Durance frowns, pauses, then his eyes take on an eager gleam. "But here's one..."

"I can speak to how the losing side sees her, and that should tell you enough. Let me speak to what an Aedyran sees."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>

      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>81</ID>
      <DefaultText>"The Aedyrans have a... proper, polite translation for her. 'Excellence in war. Tactical discipline.'" He snorts. 

"That's why they lost the fucking colony, of course. They were properly still quoting that while we had them bent across the decks."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />

    <Entry>
      <ID>82</ID>
      <DefaultText>"All their guns and cannons are fine, but useless when your staff is cracking light into their skulls, dispensing red gifts left and right." Durance's fists tighten, and he laughs. "Aedyrans call that 'elevation,' 'divine awareness.'"

"Those words are as welcome as shit on one's boots, and that's all they took back with them while they were running..." He shakes his head. "A lesson learned, at the wrong time. Almost feel a pang of sympathy for them... almost."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />

      <DefaultText>"Lesson? What do you mean?"</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>85</ID>
      <DefaultText>"The title of a god isn't KNOWING a god. Adhering to words rather than walking the path, testing yourself in the heat of it... Walk until the words are stripped away, and you feel it, burning in your heart. That is the lesson."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>86</ID>
      <DefaultText>"That... Aedyran 'politeness,' that pretty adherence to the word of scripture as they saw it... THAT burned their ships, scarred them, kept them running throughout the Dyrwood campaign."

He snorts. "'Divine awareness.' There's no true faith in waiting to be tested. The best in battle have already shit themselves plenty, shit themselves until they're dry and can focus on the killing."</DefaultText>
