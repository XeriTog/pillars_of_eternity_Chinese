      <DefaultText>You find yourself back in the space inside the Grieving Mother's mind. It is familiar this time, and even though you feel you have seen countless births from this vantage point, something fills you with unease.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You hear something. The sound is strange, dissonant, like warping metal. You grit your teeth against the noise, and yet, as it rises, the eerie melody drives the numbness from your limbs and clears a space in the mist.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>And once again you are drawing forth life, something warm and fragile struggling into the world. 

This scene feels familiar, a moment you have lived - and dreamed - a thousand times before, and yet something ominous gnaws at the edges. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The woman should be in pain, the natural pain of childbirth, you know this, but... it is faint, distant, and you realize that you're soothing the pain with your mind, smoothing out the eddies of pain and relaxing her thoughts just enough so that she can still push from within, push the child forth...</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>...you are taking that pain onto yourself, but the pain has layers... one is a pressure, a familiar, welcoming pain, and the other... it is sharp, a razor at your consciousness... more recent than this memory.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>And as you try to recall how you've reached this place, you feel the same hollowness inside yourself, a pit filled with the clawing winds of a bîaŵac. The very thought fills you with disquiet, like the memory of a nightmare.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>...as your hands move, you hear the sound of chimes, clear and sharp. 

Yet somewhere distant, they seem echoed by something else... wails of sorrow, tolling bells? It's impossible to tell.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>An inexplicable sense of dread fills your soul as the child makes its journey to you, push by push. A malicious presence seems to surround you, and you lean forward to shield the child. 

At last, the baby emerges, wet and ruddy from its journey. A lifetime seems to have passed as the newborn moved from womb to world, and another seems to pass as you cradle the trembling child, waiting...</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The child cries out, its cry full of life... full of soul, the chime echoing in its thoughts, filling it with its welcome. The soul is blurred at the edges, as if you are viewing a soul... from within a soul... but it is there. It is alive. The woman before you is weeping, and at her first cry, her hands reach out for it...</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>...you surrender the child to her, something you have done many times before... and as your hands move, the dull clangor sounds, and you feel a weight hanging from your wrist.

You look down and see bones, tiny and malformed, hanging from a string about your wrist. They're heavier than they should be, and as they clank together, they make a noise like funeral bells.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The mother is too intent upon her newborn to pay you any heed, and so you hide your wrist behind your back. She need never know... can't ever know...

As you hide the bone chimes, you shiver - in relief, with premonition, at the chill wind that suddenly sweeps the plateau...</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The morning is cold and silent. You are upon the plateau of the Birthing Bell, and there is no sound, no wind. The sky is a smooth mortared gray, the forest beneath the plateau nothing more than a jagged black silhouette. Even the rock, the adra around you... it feels colder, the sun's warmth bled from it.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Against the cold backdrop of the sky, you see the great Birthing Bell, hanging from its arch of adra. Its surface is tarnished, and the shadows inside the bell are dark, still. It seems to press down upon you... or simply, sadly, watching, as if standing above a grave formed from the table of the plateau and the remains of the mother's womb that now covers its surface.</DefaultText>

      <ID>46</ID>
      <DefaultText>And there is something heavy in your hands... it breathes, gurgling, slick and wet, yet that is all it is. You find yourself filled with fear... you don't want to look at what you are holding, you don't want to touch it with your mind, and it is all you can do not to cast it from you.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The mass before you is vacant, flesh in the shape of a newborn. Bubbles of saliva bunch at the mouth, expelled by its steady, gurgling breath, its arms, legs, head lolling, limp. No thought, no struggle, no desire to cry in protest or pain, there is nothing from within... there is an absence in your hands. </DefaultText>

      <ID>50</ID>
      <DefaultText>Your hands tremble, shake... and the silence is broken as the chimes on your wrists echo with the trembling...

...and the chimes do not echo in the thoughts of the mass in your hands. There is no soul within to hear it.</DefaultText>

      <ID>52</ID>
      <DefaultText>The only emotions blanketing the plateau are the pain of the mother... the child breathes, its heart beats... but it makes no cry. The child feels light... empty. There is no joy in it, no fear, no thoughts at all... yet in the hollows inside it, it breathes, a thing of habit, not life.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />

      <ID>53</ID>
      <DefaultText>...you cannot move. Your trembling has subsided, and the birthing chimes on your wrists are as still as the child. The mother is crying, eager to see, begging to see the child. You feel a sudden spike of fear... of being hunted. If you give the child to the mother... you will be blamed, and her anguish and rage shall fall upon you. She will not spare you or anyone you love, of this you are certain.

But you did not cause this. You don't think you caused it.

And the mother begs, her arms outstretched...</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The chimes sound once more as you give the child to its mother. And as the chime fades, there is the eager gleam, the welling joy, the questioning...

...and you draw upon it, deeply, letting the hope stream into her eyes, letting her ears fill with the cries that you have heard countless times past from other children on the bell. </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>56</ID>
      <DefaultText>You hear the laughter in the mother's voice, in streams of tears that run down her face... and with a practiced motion, you weave a life that will never be into her eyes and thoughts... she will care for the child as if it were whole until you set her free. She will care for it until you find a way to heal what has happened... until the reality cannot be dispelled anymore.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>57</ID>
      <DefaultText>And still, cradled beneath the weeping woman that birthed it, the child in her arms does not hear the cries of the mother, does not react. It is an empty thing that breathes and carries nothing within it.

And the chimes on your wrists lie still. They are bound to you like chains, never to sound inside a newborn's mind ever again.</DefaultText>
