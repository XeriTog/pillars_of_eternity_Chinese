      <DefaultText>Chewing on a piece of uncooked meat, a small orlan dressed in tattered leathers offers a mumbled greeting and waves his hand.

Despite his pleasant smile, the upper right portion of his face is in a sorry state. An eye patch stitched with a stylized eyeball wraps around his head; and his ear is a mangled remnant that twitches and spasms while the other ear perks up at your approach.

Next to him is the splayed carcass of a deer that appears ripped open by a bear or wolf.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"If this is your deer, you need a new game warden." He smiles, bits of sinew and tendon dangle from his bloody lips. His one good eye twinkles. "Name's Hiravias. Hungry? I can't eat all of this."

Taking a step back, he spreads his arm wide, presenting the carcass to you. "First catch of the day, help yourself."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He chuckles and scratches the stump of his half-severed right ear. "One ornery stelgaer. Though looking at the deer's insides, it had a malformed - but delicious - heart and would've been dead within the year regardless..."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Galawain chose a fitting end for this fine animal." He bows his head to the deer, starts to breathlessly chant, but then stops abruptly. "Pardon me, I shouldn't pray with my mouth full."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Other than the delicious venison? New trees to document, new animals to sketch, new sights to be seen. I've learned as much as I can from the druids of my circle. I'd rather wander and learn than take root and stagnate."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"So if you're traveling the Dyrwood and need another set of hands," he gives you a toothy grin, "I'd welcome the safety of a group."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I'm trained by the Celebrants of Hawk and Ivy of the Fisher Crane tribe. I know more than my share of nature magic and... well..." An impish smile overcomes his face. "I don't shy away from a good fight."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I have business with the druids that live near Twin Elms. So long as we find ourselves there eventually, I'm happy to follow along."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He darts forward and grips you by the sides. "Splendid! It'll be an honor to run with a pack for a change!"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>His one good eye narrows and shrugs. "Well, think it over, perhaps."

He bows his head to you and resumes chewing on a scrap of deer flesh. "Take care, traveler, mind your footing in the gorge."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>His posture straightens and he folds his arms. "I'm a stranger around these parts and I've had enough of solo travel for the time being." He stares at you with a concerned expression and scratches the fur around his half-severed ear.

"But it was just an offer, friend. If you have no need of an experienced druid, so be it."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"As a child, I would worship Galawain in hopes of being a great hunter but," he points to the eye patch, "I have since come to know Wael, He Who Sees and Is Not Seen."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />

      <DefaultText>"Lord of the Hunt, Patron of all Seekers..." his voice falls flat. "I'm the wrong person to ask."

He brushes his hair aside, allowing a closer examination of his eye patch - a stylized pattern of an eye is embroidered on the worn leather.</DefaultText>

      <ID>31</ID>
      <DefaultText>"And ruin the original texture? That's the best part!" He chuckles and wipes deer bits from his lips. "Just see for yourself."

Turning his attention to the corpse, he plunges his hands into the deer's vivisected abdomen.</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>33</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Well you'll have to find the stelgaer that did the deed." He takes another bite of uncooked meat. "I just found the corpse. No crime against being a vulture in these parts last I checked."</DefaultText>

      <ID>34</ID>

    <Entry>
      <ID>35</ID>
      <DefaultText>His eye widens in excitement and he reaches into the deer carcass. "Great! You can have the best part."

He puts his foot against the deer and, with a wet ripping noise, yanks free a length of rope-like flesh as long as he is tall.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>With a smile, he holds the truncated end of the beast's innards in front of you. "Eat up."</DefaultText>

      <ID>38</ID>
      <DefaultText>In a half-hearted show of enticement he waves the intestine in front of you. "Not even a bite?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>[Eat it.]</DefaultText>

      <ID>40</ID>
      <DefaultText>As you reach out to grab it he snaps his hand back with a startled laugh. "Gods no, don't eat it! I assumed you realized I was being a churlish ponce."

He chuckles and drops the mass of viscera, "I applaud your bravery but unless you've a cast iron stomach, I don't recommend eating the feces tube."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>

    <Entry>
      <ID>42</ID>
      <DefaultText>His one eye locks yours and he tears off several inches of intestine with one ripping bite. He slowly chews, his eye squinting at you.</DefaultText>

      <ID>44</ID>
      <DefaultText>"So..." he mumbles as his face winces, "... delicious..." He diligently chews and swallows the offal with a forced smile.

"Now I know the deer had elderberries for its last meal," he says as he smacks his lips. "Are you sure you don't want to try some?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The one-eyed orlan waves to you with a large grin. He brushes his hands across his worn tunic, and a flurry of leaves, bugs, and fur shakes lose.

"Hello again, traveler. Is there something on your mind?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You hear a gurgling rumble next to you. Sagani places her hand on her stomach. Her eyes are on the carcass. "Still fresh."

Itumaak's pink tongue lolls out of his mouth.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Sagani looks from you to the orlan. "Is no one going to eat that?" Itumaak licks his lips and whines.</DefaultText>

      <ID>56</ID>
      <DefaultText>The orlan smiles, opens his mouth as if to speak, and then falls silent.

"Wael is the god of mystery and obfuscation. Wael does little to intervene, dictate, or limit our actions - but nor does he make himself easily known. I would say I contemplate Wael more than I follow or serve him."</DefaultText>
