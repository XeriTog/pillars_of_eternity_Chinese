      <DefaultText>A dwarven woman, dressed in skins and hides, leans against the road marker. Her face is turned down, her eyes darkened by a thick stripe of face paint. 

She's sharpening a bone arrowhead with a scrimshaw-handled knife. Her attention, however, is focused on a bear figurine between her feet.

A large, white-furred fox standing at her heels looks up at your approach.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"That's what I heard. Of course, the man who told me so was carrying a staff he claimed was made from dragon bone, but I know whitewood when I see it."

      <DefaultText>She dusts the figurine on her trousers and raises it in her small, flat palm. It's carved in the shape of a bear, smooth and round. The polished adra is worn to a dull matte along its arched back and ovoid haunches. A soft glow emanates from within.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Fine. But if you try to run, just remember that my arrows are faster." She hands you the figurine, her chapped knuckles grazing your hand.

      <DefaultText>You're standing on a cliff overlooking the water, seeing through eyes that aren't your own. You catch the musk of beasts amidst the fresh scent of vegetation, and your heart beats a little faster. You'll have to watch your step up here.

You look down just long enough to see the sharp, pale cliffs drop into the water hundreds of feet below you.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She grins. "Another old village tradition. The elders watched the caribou migrations and cast seal bones to determine the right time for this journey. 

"When the omens were determined, all the village wives drew shark teeth. We're the ones that go away to hunt and fish, so we're the best suited for a task like this."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She scratches behind his ear. "A good hunter but not much of a talker, and that's been fine by me.

"When we hunt in Naasitaq, we almost always bring our foxes with us. They help us track and flush game, and they're fearless defenders against bears and snow leopards. Clever Itumaak has always been my favorite." 

He wags his brushy tail.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She pulls the bear figurine out of her satchel, running a finger along its smooth back. "It's something we've always done.

      <DefaultText>"We also believe that passing our history on in this way keeps us stronger.

      <DefaultText>Sagani looks at you, her arms folded across her chest. "If this is your idea of a joke, you may be stuck with me for a while."

She tucks the figurine into her pouch, and her fox stands, shaking its pale coat. "Lead the way."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Most often, they return somewhere in Naasitaq, a member of another village. Or they're reborn among the Glamfellen of the White that Wends. Even so, it's hard to say what's usual."

A mischievous grin crinkles her eyes. "When my grandfather was a boy, the elder came back as a polar bear. The huntress chosen for the task had to recite half of her village's deeds while running from the beast."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I've had five. Yakona, Estuya, Najuo, Aniik, and Malaak. Estuya and Aniik died young in long, lean winters. Malaak was barely talking when I left." She scrapes a thumbnail along the handle of her hunting knife. "He probably won't know me when I get home."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Kallu's a good man. He's raised our children well and built us a strong home while I've been away on hunts. 

"Our parents chose us for one another when we were still young. Not the way things are usually done here, but ours chose well." She smiles. "We came to appreciate each other as helpmates first, then friends, and then... well, you know how it goes." There's a hint of a blush below the stripe of face paint.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I'm a long hunter. I stalk game across the tundra with some of the other wives. We usually hunt caribou and oxen, but we find hares and birds, too.

    <Entry>
      <ID>162</ID>
      <DefaultText>"That depends on the man or woman he's become. It's easiest when the rebirth happens in another village of Naasitaq, where the tradition is understood. Even in the White that Wends and the southern islands of the Deadfire Archipelago, people understand this custom and will welcome you politely enough, even if their souls do not remember." </DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>163</ID>
      <DefaultText>She shrugs. "But, sometimes you find someone whose soul has no memory of the village, and you have to tell him of people who remember him still. As disheartening as this is, you hope that the reminder will aid his soul in a future life."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Naasitaq?" She rubs her nose with one broad finger. "It's a big island in the middle of the Deadfire Archipelago, just off the coast of the White that Wends. Tundra, mostly, with a few snow-covered forests in the warmer parts.

"Most of us live in fairly small villages - by standards here, anyway. Mine is Massuk." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She shrugs. "Cold, but not as cold as the White that Wends. The few kith who visit Naasitaq find it... sparse. But there's plenty to sustain a village if you know where to look."

She ticks the items off on her calloused fingers. "We get hides and meat from caribou, seals, and small whales. Bone, too, which makes fine bows and arrowheads."</DefaultText>

"I'm from an island to the far south called Naasitaq. I came here looking for a village elder, a man we knew as Persoq. I'm a hunter back home, so tracking someone wouldn't normally be a problem.

      <DefaultText>"When I left Naasitaq, it was completely dark inside. But as I've gotten closer to Persoq, it's glowed steadily brighter. Since I've reached the Dyrwood, however, it's gotten hard to read. Some days it flickers and goes dark. Others, it shines nice and bright... for a few hours.

"I went to see this fellow and gave him the adra figurine. He made a big show of moaning and rolling his eyes, and after I'd given him five Golden Ducs to lift the Shroud, he told me to seek the crossroads in the field between the 'wolf's lair' and the 'twining trees.'"</DefaultText>

"I had a bad taste in my mouth, but my coin was spent and I'd already left an arrow in his knapsack as a friendly warning. Told him I'd come back and leave him with another if it turned out he was giving me the run-around.
