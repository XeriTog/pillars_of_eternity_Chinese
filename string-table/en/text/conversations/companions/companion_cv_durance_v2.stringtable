      <DefaultText>Squatting at the base of this statue is an incredibly ugly man, with bulging red cheeks raked by pox scars, and a scraggly beard. He is sweating, as if he has a fever, but his breathing is measured and steady... like a slow push of a blacksmith's bellows, but that comparison feels strange and unwelcome.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The next comparison, possibly sparked by his grin, is that of a bear trap... and then out of nowhere, there is the hint of alchemical fire... that fades almost as soon as you identify the smell.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Come to pray at the statue?"

The question mark is barely there. As the man makes the statement, the statue takes on a reddish cast, as if one is holding a torch to it, then slowly blossoms into waving flames. The man doesn't turn as the statue blossoms into fire.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"The others are welcome, but it's best if just you and I trade words, and your shadows stay quiet, hands off their weapons - both arcane and steel."

His face tenses with his iron bear trap smile, ready to spring. "It's only you I want to trade words with anyway."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Traveling by yourself." The tone is approving. "It's best you and I trade words, and your hands lay off your weapons - arcane and steel." 

The tension in his face relaxes, and the bear trap grin fades. "It's only you I want to trade words with anyway."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The weaving firelight from the statue gives off no heat, so much so, you wonder if it is some trick of the mind... the ugly man before you doesn't seem to notice it, or feel it, although the sheen on his brow is still present, as if he's burning up from within.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />

      <ID>20</ID>
      <DefaultText>The man smiles slightly at your words... then nods, never taking his eyes off you. "I could do better. Though the road holds little... else." His eyes run the length of your frame, and he follows it with a sneer. "Until now."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The man shrugs, so casual as to add a further insult with its dismissiveness. </DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>23</ID>
      <DefaultText>"But if I give offense..." The man's face cracks a smile with teeth, almost a dare. "If words are all that are left to a man - then why, in the Dyrwood of all places, he should have leave to speak them."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The sudden weaving flames from the statue of Magran cast more light on his features. The man's robes are dirty, stained with grease, and other marks of the road...
 
The hems of his robes, including the sleeves, are burned at the edges, as if he walked a great distance across a fire, then reached into the flames with his hands to pull something out. </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />

      <DefaultText>But while his hands are thick and callused, they bear no burn or scorch marks.</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>26</ID>
      <DefaultText>The staff looks thick, stout, of blackened ash once burned by a terrible fire. Beneath the ash, the lines in the wood bear shapes and patterns... and there is a certainty the staff was once something far more dangerous... but not now.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>27</ID>
      <DefaultText>As you study it deeper, it shimmers slightly in your eyes, like water catching the light weaving across the statue. Whatever power was bled from the staff, it doesn't make it - or the wielder - any less dangerous.

You look up to see the man watching you studying the staff. As his gaze meets yours, he nods with a humorless smile.</DefaultText>

      <ID>28</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I didn't give it." The man grunts. "You probably find names as useless as I do..." His hand tightens around the staff. 

"The names that litter this world like debris are hard enough to wrap around the tongue, and what do they matter?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"It's what's beneath the skin and the letters I care about, what burns within. It's more important to me you're a Watcher than whatever culture or accent decorates your letters like awkward crowns.

"Take pride in your actions, not where you hail from..." The man's staff blossoms with fire for a moment, then the embers settle. "...or how your name rolls off whatever liar's tongue coats it now."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I don't force my words on anyone other than you. I don't care who walks with you or what their mewling problems and politics are... there's enough howling in the world without me stoking that fire.

"I won't take from your provisions, don't need much on the road. I can carry my weight..." he inhales, again giving you the impression of a blacksmith bellows, and he smiles, almost proudly. "Which is considerable."</DefaultText>

      <ID>44</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Many will stand against you." He stares at you for a moment, his brow creasing. "They probably already have, from what I can see... left their marks, it seems, like a trail, worming its way behind you."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He stares at your face, then into your eyes – almost dully at first, then more intently. "Disease? Spirit wind?" He shrugs. "Both could have touched you, yet here you stand."</DefaultText>

      <ID>50</ID>
      <DefaultText>"As for disease..." He taps the pox scars on his face. "Not all of us were close to water when the pox hit, but it's no longer a passenger in my flesh. It left its marks as well. 

"But like flames, the pox doesn't strike twice, nor is it catching."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"You think me a burden?" Durance's face twists into a sneer. "I'm here to help you, Watcher. And you can help me with nothing more than letting me walk with you.

      <DefaultText>"Watcher." Durance turns his pox-scarred face to yours, his eyes burning, almost eagerly. "I thought you might see differently. Here again, the three of us - you, me, and the whore. Have you changed your mind?"</DefaultText>

"And Eothas... Waidwen had always claimed to be invading Dyrwood to FREE it. What if it were true? What if he had come to stop Woedica's plot before it began?"</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>108</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Surely, Eothas earned his death at Godhammer Citadel, but not for those reasons... not to keep him silent.

"If such a thing has brought about this chaos..." Durance tilts his head, as if listening to an inner voice... then he frowns, the frown deepening as he speaks.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Durance looks at you for a moment, then his lip peels back, sneering. "Is this some final joke at my expense? To test my faith further?" He laughs, loud and harsh. "And why would you think that, Watcher?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Durance frowns - and his smile dies as he stares at you. "If all you have are questions, then I have enough of those. She is a bitch of a goddess to be sure... but even a whore only goes so far in crossing those she serves."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Durance is silent for a moment, and when he speaks again, he speaks low and slowly, almost carefully. "You answer a question with a question." He frowns. "Then why did I feel her disappointment at Halgot? Why were we shamed?"</DefaultText>

"She is a goddess. I still drink from her burning breasts, Watcher." His face burns, and his hand clenches tight on the staff. "If she wished me dead, she could trace me to my source and kill me."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>When your vision clears, you see Durance, his hands clutching the staff, and his eyes are bright, burning red. Atop the staff, the flame burns cleanly, brightly. As his gaze burns, he rips his gaze away and howls, a bellowing horrid howl, like a wounded animal, and sweat pours down his brow.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>As he studies the staff, you feel a wave of heat, a terrible energy rolling forth from it in waves, so much so it feels as if the Godhammer itself is alive in his hands... and past it, you hear a cry, like a child being born, and your eyes feel the flash of white, then a hundred imagined shades of purple and white, streaming and circling into the howling of a storm, and beneath it, the grinding of ancient machines of stone, rock, and metal... grinding and turning until all around you feels as if it's burning, sinking into the shadows of the earth... beneath the ground, the only place where a spirit might find refuge.</DefaultText>

His face becomes stone, his eyes still burning, almost hungrily. "I still take from her strength as I did... for as long as it lasts." Durance snarls. "For I shall not cast her aside yet until I have drained her dry and had my fill... just as she intended for me."</DefaultText>
