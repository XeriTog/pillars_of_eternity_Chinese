      <DefaultText>"We can't really control what happens to them, [Player Name]. Nor should we try. I had to see the monster Thaos had become to realize that."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"So many hopes and dreams, all of them torn from the cycle and trapped for... for Wael knows how long!"

Hiravias scratches his chin and looks you up and down. "Now's your chance to free them, [Player Name]. Think of how many new lives and new journeys could start this very moment - it's all in your hands."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"To think, the decisions the Engwithans made thousands of years ago still shape our lives today." She shakes her head. "It would be a shame to deny these souls the chance to find their own way and their own purpose."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"We should strengthen the Dyrwood. They've suffered enough." She sighs. "I know the ducs want to keep the Dyrwood weak, but it will hurt the Republics in the generations to come. I know this is what's best for us."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The Grieving Mother closes her eyes and gives you a single deep nod. "It has been an honor to journey with you... to help you purge Thaos' evil from the Dyrwood."

The chimes at her wrists sound as she knits her fingers together. "And now another choice lies before you. Please, Watcher - restore these souls to their homes, their families. Let people remember the healing that followed the Legacy."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"This is beyond either of us, [Player Name]. The certainty of the gods is a mercy. Just look at how Thaos was crushed by the burden of his own position." He levels his gaze at you. "It's not something I would wish on anyone else."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"All of these notions of who we are, what shapes us..." She shakes her head. "None of it really matters, does it? And yet if we could heal these broken families, I suppose our journey would be worth something." Itumaak licks at her fingers.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"It's a bitter thing to have come so far only to find that it was all for nothing. Somehow, I don't think we're any better off, knowing what we do." She gazes ruefully at the adra pillar.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Hiravias slaps you on the side with a beaming smile. "Well done, [Player Name]. Just take a second to savor the victory - you've earned this moment. And you've won the right, if you wish, to use these souls as fodder to strengthen the living. A true hunter provides strength and sustenance for the whole tribe."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Our search brought us here. A hunt for truth that pulled like fate. Perhaps there's something to be said for mystery." Kana looks at you. "But it is your choice, my friend." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"After all we've seen, [Player Name], I have to wonder if it isn't cruel, returning them to what they were. We've seen what answers lay in store for them. What purpose can they find, if none exists?" </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"The ducs would want the Dyrwood to stay weak so we can take over trade with the Glanfathans." She appears conflicted but eventually nods in resignation. "I have to trust in their judgment. Consigning the souls to entropy is the best course."</DefaultText>

The chimes at her wrists sound as she knits her fingers together. "And yet if we would free ourselves from his legacy, you must first free the souls he has trapped. His work cannot be undone... chaining these souls to broken lives will only prolong it."</DefaultText>
