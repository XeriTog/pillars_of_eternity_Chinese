      <DefaultText>"To think I spent so long searching for that poor beast. Whatever Persoq becomes next, I doubt he'll remember any of this."

She pauses, wondering. "And yet those five minutes with him were more than I've spent with my family in five years."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I'm sure Massuk will talk about my Tarneq-Ilitsaak for years to come. And by the time I've had my fill of blubber and fermented milk, I'll tire of telling the story.

"But that's what it'll be to the rest of Massuk - a story. And I'll just be a figure in it. It's Kallu, Yakona, Najuo, and Malaak who know me as more."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She dusts her hands on her trousers. "Anyway, Thaos isn't getting any closer. I suppose we'd best keep after him."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"To be honest, the biggest relief is knowing that my journey was worthwhile. That finding Persoq and carrying our village's story to him will strengthen our community and return his soul to us."

Her eyes go into soft focus. "I'm looking forward to being back in Massuk among my family and my people. But more than anything, I'm glad to finally understand the purpose behind these last five years."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I can't help but wonder what any of this meant. Whether Persoq's life with us even mattered when it could be covered up like tracks under new snow."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"But for how long? A season? A century?"

She shakes her head. "One day, something will separate us. Cold. Famine. Illness. And when it does, we'll be cast to the Wheel and flung to new corners of existence. Like snowflakes scattered on the wind."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Her shoulders slump. "I should. I want to. But knowing what I know now... I can feel each moment melting away, gone. Lost. It's difficult not to be conscious of something like that."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"And now he's gone. And whether he'd been an elder or an outcast, he would have gone on to become a deer.

"To be honest, I'm not even sure I believe the old stories any more. I'm not sure whether those things really happened the way people say or whether we've built them up so we can have something to stand on."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"No doubt. Even if Persoq doesn't remember our conversation, his soul does, and it will be stronger for it.
