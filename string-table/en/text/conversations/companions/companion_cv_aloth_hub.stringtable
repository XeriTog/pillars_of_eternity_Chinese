      <DefaultText>"I've been gone for more than a year now, but I suspect I'll always think of the forests and fields of Aedyr as home. We've thousands of years of history and tradition behind us, and there's a sense of dignity and responsibility that comes with that."

He frowns. "Of course, there's baggage, as well. Our imperial past is still fresh in the minds of many, as you may have noticed here."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"My mother instructed me to keep her a secret after she first emerged. She feared that knowledge of my Awakening would render me an outcast. 

"Even though Iselmyr proved useful against my father, I trusted my mother's advice, and I've since come to see the wisdom behind it. Maerwald is an extreme example, but one that I can relate to more and more each year."</DefaultText>

"At times he could be rather... adamant. Particularly when he'd been drinking. Iselmyr manifested on one such occasion. To be honest, I don't remember the specifics. Only that he was more careful with me after that."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Despite his initial agreement with the arrangement, Father was never happy with it. He would hound and harangue my mother when she was home. He wanted to know whether she was intimate with the thayn, and no matter how many times she swore she wasn't, it was never enough. 

"As you can imagine, that led to her coming home much less often even though she still supported us financially."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>44</ID>
      <DefaultText>"A ceremonial marriage between folk and elf. Because the Aedyre mainland has historically been split between the two races, we have many institutions that are designed to normalize relations. Our monarchy is headed by folk, but an elven consort rules alongside the reigning ferc&#246;nyng or mecwyn. This is the most prominent example of haemneg."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>45</ID>
      <DefaultText>"In many cases, a haemneg allows two households to pool resources. Among the aristocracy, haemnegs consolidate power. Sometimes, as in my mother's case, a haemneg is a means for a noble to add another administrator to his or her household. Consorts are received with almost the same level of respect as their noble counterparts, which can be extremely useful."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>46</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Of course, haemnegs are sometimes used to sanitize an extramarital affair." He shrugs. "I don't know that it's really any better, but it seems to satisfy common notions of decency. And elf and folk unions are sterile, which no doubt eases some concerns."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"He had a problem with my mother's haemneg. Even though they agreed upon it long ago, that the financial benefits would be considerable, that it was little different from his role as the erl's steward, it ate at him. And so he drank and raged. When she was home, he raged at her, and when she wasn't, he raged at me."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"More than anything, he wanted me to become an arcane knight in the service of his erl. I think he felt this would validate his chosen career and master.

      <DefaultText>"Relaxing. More so than I expected. As contentious as she is, I imagined that letting her in would merely unleash the torrent. But now that I'm not fighting her, it seems she isn't fighting me."

    <Entry>
      <ID>65</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Just... calmer. Content. It's odd, for so long I fought her, lashing out at her intrusions and incursions without actually stopping her. I wasn't used to taking decisive action, and I didn't believe I'd have power over someone who had infiltrated my own mind."
