      <DefaultText>"That's enough, ambassador. We are capable of speaking for ourselves." The slight elf standing to the ambassador's side smirks and toys with a stiletto, lightly jabbing his captive in the ribs for emphasis. His bright green eyes turn upward to lock with Pallegina's angry stare.</DefaultText>
