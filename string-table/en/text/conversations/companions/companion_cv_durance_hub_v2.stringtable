      <DefaultText>Durance frowns. "Eothas was the god of rebirth, and his light does not fall on the Dyrwood. I've heard some claim it's his doing, his death... it's closed the halls to new souls. 

"I doubt it, the Hollowborn have their roots in the acts of men, women, I feel it."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>98</ID>
      <DefaultText>"That's a curse that runs deeper." Durance's voice becomes bitter. "It's a Godhammer of a different sort, and like the Godhammer, it was made by men's hands."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"All things have a price. Left unchecked, faithlessness, virtues... it leaves marks on souls. Until souls don't have the strength to enter bodies that are pure.

      <ID>100</ID>
      <DefaultText>Durance glares at you. "Even Watchers can do the same. Some simply watch... others try to weave souls, guide them as surely as Waidwen across Evon Dewr."

He turns away. "That is why I correct the Hollowborn when I find them. And the ones whose hands have led to this seed being spilled on the ground."

    <Entry>
      <ID>105</ID>
      <DefaultText>Durance snorts. "I feel more remorse in putting down a slathering hound. A wicht? Less than a mongrel in its misery. 

"Murder is a kindness, not a crime, always has been. I would sooner put the blade to those who are to blame instead. If any spirits should be punished, it's theirs."</DefaultText>

      <ID>107</ID>
      <DefaultText>"The fields of the Dyrwood are filled with weakness, ripe for those that play with souls, minds..." His face wrinkles in a frown. "Animancers and their kind. Watchers, too. They bear more of the burden than their victims, and more of the punishment. 

"Every year has seen a new crime... the Saint's War, the Hollowborn... and the Salvation."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>110</ID>
      <DefaultText>"There are few who can shape a soul in such a fashion." Durance stares at you. "And any Watcher, any true Watcher born in the Dyrwood, would be able to see the crime even if they did not cause it. Silence itself is damning."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>111</ID>

      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>112</ID>
      <DefaultText>Durance laughs coldly. "Murder you? I would not grant you - any of them - the mercy that I grant the Hollowborn. You would not be deserving of it."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>113</ID>
      <DefaultText>"You'd equate murder with mercy?"</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>114</ID>
      <DefaultText>Durance scoffs. "Murder is an old word - mercy is letting a soul fly free to the next body. True punishment? Ruining someone to their soul." Durance's hand tightens on his staff, as if reciting a cadence. "Crack their spirit like you would crack their skulls with a staff...

"...beat them, hurt them in mind and body, so their souls become shards... but you leave it inside the vessel like a bag of glass, to either choke on it or pass it through their bloody stool."</DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>115</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Then..." He makes a locking motion with a twist of his hand, then grins, satisfied. "...leave it in the body to think on it. Like planting a new field with the right seed."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>116</ID>
      <DefaultText>"That sounds like you've committed it to memory."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>117</ID>
      <DefaultText>Durance becomes somber, quoting. "'Many marks may I make upon your flesh, but flame leaves marks that cannot heal.'

"Magran doctrine dictates true punishment is one that remains in memory. In memory, in the soul, in the flesh.

"Even should the victims die... slowly or swift, sometimes by their own hand afterwards... the lesson lingers, burned in their flesh."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>118</ID>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>121</ID>
      <DefaultText>"It was not of him..." Durance frowns. "It was worth keeping - embracing, rather than adding to the empty churn on the Wheel or letting a spirit's crime persist and find a new home."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>122</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Have you seen a man branded by flame? He remembers it always - in every waking movement. It is a lesson writ in the only ink and vellum that matters - blood and flesh.

"One can burn the soul as well. It is an art, and I do not take pleasure in it, but there is more at stake here than forgiveness.

"Many of Eothas' faith were punished in the Purges following the Saint's War... and the ones that harmed children, they suffered worse."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>124</ID>
      <DefaultText>Durance's face hardens, his hand clenches his staff. "We did what must be done. Wherever they were, they were rooted out, their souls reclaimed.

"And if they couldn't be reclaimed, we insured they would never inhabit another body."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Dyrwood's the best of them, still has spirit, if a land can have one. It's a place where a man can walk freely - even make new roads, and that's a rare thing in this world.

    <Entry>
      <ID>127</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Yes. Whatever twist Woedica has done to generations... and to think, I thought it involved men and women, not their gods... and to use children as a lever against a stubborn door for the sake of politics.

"As if the Gods should be above that. More fool I."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>128</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Yes. Eothas' last stab at revenge after he was ended."

Durance frowns. "Eothas was the god of rebirth, and his light does not fall on the Dyrwood. I've heard some claim it's his doing, his death... it's closed the halls to new souls."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He scoffs. "I assumed the problem was a thing born of women and men, nations driven by them, always circling... within and without. The Vailian Republics, Readceras... the Saint's War... one big bladed spiral, shredding everything around it."</DefaultText>

      <ID>130</ID>
      <DefaultText>He scoffs. "I don't believe it. The problem is closer than that, and as always, it involves women and men. And they are always circling... within and without.

      <DefaultText>"Couldn't stand to remain? Don't blame you." He glares at you with a half-smile, which fades. "You look more humble than most - any country so obsessed with style might as well be wearing scarves over their eyes."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"The Dyrwood had best be vigilant, or they'll turn them into slaves as soon as ink dries on the trade treaty. 

"The Dyrwood and all its internal riches is too tempting..." Durance's voice drops. "Especially if someone else tames the country and the face-painters for them."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Durance grunts. "Any country so obsessed with style might as well be wearing scarves over their eyes.

      <DefaultText>Durance's face flushes... and a sheen of sweat forms on his brow. "Too many adjectives to that so-called nation... civil unrest, economic collapse, all tinder, just needing the right spark.

      <DefaultText>"This 'divine kingdom' he tries to set up? Goes about as well as you'd expect." A trickle of sweat runs down the side of Durance's cheek, and sinks into his beard. "Suddenly, the population of heretics goes up by about half and again, and Eothas starts turning his blood-stained gaze to every blasphemer he can find."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"It's not a country, it's a gathering of cowards. Aedyr puppets.

"They used to be an optimistic bunch. A bright bunch..." Durance laughs at bright, as if a private joke. "Was their undoing. Should have embraced their misery without letting a farmer lead them to a... brighter ruin."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Almost Eothas puppets, too. Put an end to that.

      <ID>152</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Wasn't a war. It was a god stepping past himself. The country of Readceras and all their heathens..." Durance growls. "They're paying for it now, although by my count, the fire should have roared through their country with more force, catching all their souls.

"Truth - it wasn't even a war, it was a cautionary tale, about pride - specifically Waidwen's pride. He should have stayed a farmer."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>155</ID>
      <DefaultText>"The 'War' was an act of arrogance, born straight from Readceras' twitching legs. A man thinking himself more than a man." Durance snorts. "Want to kill someone? Tell him a god speaks through him.

"Then tell him he means him to lead. Which puts him at the front of any army. And the army was as strong as you'd expect for Readceras, as sick as that country was to begin with - yet a war was likely just what they needed."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Readceras has its share of troubles. It deserves all of them. It deserved Waidwen, he was the light that led them to flame.

"Readceras was in decline, Aedyr poison already eating its veins. Economic bleeding, the dying of their faith..." Durance frowns. "...then Waidwen, this farmer, claims to take up Eothas in the flesh, and gives them the worst kind of hope."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"They crown him." Durance taps his head, making a slight bow, and when his face turns back to you, he's wearing a feral smile. "They make him king, the worst kind of blasphemy.

"And once he wears the crown on his head and the god in his flesh - why, he starts making changes, divine changes." Durance's eyes blaze. 

"Then he decides he's going to change us. Save us."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"He marches on the Dyrwood to free us. To free us from our beliefs, like he freed the other souls in Readceras.

"Cold Morn offers up its belly with no resistance, and it's spared." Durance snarls. "The bloodshed starts when he sacks Mercy Vale. A touch of irony, that. Puts it to the flame." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Durance holds his staff, and his hands lock around it, tracing the etchings. As you watch, the top of the staff blossoms, burns brightly, and Durance speaks, his face illuminated in the fire.

"A weapon that would burn brighter than Eothas. And we led him to it and burned him at the stake.
