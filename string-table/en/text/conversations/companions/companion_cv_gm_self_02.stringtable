      <DefaultText>"My face... is like the caul of a newborn, hiding the face beneath, and for my body... I am able to wrap myself as a mother cradling her child. 

"I am here, as you see me, but to them, their eyes see only the cloak that I wear, a peasant mother, dirty, shabby, not worth knowing..."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I divert the flow of their senses down a different path, to a place easily forgotten. It is not unwelcome when one does not desire the presence of others...

"The surface of their minds register a figure, but the memory slips away. They see a woman, but there is no desire for conversation... no desire for any questions. And I have none to ask."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The air seems to go still for a moment, and time stretches as it did before when the two of you first met. There is a wash of uncertainty from her mind, slowly shaping into questions... that swirl and do not coalesce. She does not move, she seems paralyzed, as if you have just wrapped her in a cold blanket.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"That is a question for you, not I.

"That is not my name, although if you wish to hang the title on me, I cannot stop you. Is that what you see when your eyes fall upon me?"</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>43</ID>
      <DefaultText>"So... I named you?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I... welcome your questions. It is a strange sensation, after so long."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>46</ID>
      <DefaultText>"As a Watcher, you may see what I do not. Or your mind shapes the thoughts I project into a new meaning. 

"...there is truth in that title, but it is not all I am."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"So what do you grieve then?"</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>48</ID>
      <DefaultText>"You must have felt it, seen it. It has as many names as the pain it has caused."

As the words take shape, they seem to tumble from her... and the wave is great, rushing into your mind. To your surprise, you feel as if you've been touched by the b&#238;a&#373;ac again... and behind it, cutting through the torrent like a knife are the thoughts of the Grieving Mother.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"There is a wound cut across the belly of the world, a jagged knife that has stripped the stems from men and carved furrows across the wombs of women."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>51</ID>
      <DefaultText>"There is much I have forgotten... but I can feel the wound all around me. It will not let me rest, not let me be. The children have gone silent... yet, their voices may be heard again."</DefaultText>

      <ID>53</ID>
      <DefaultText>"The word..." There is a slowness of thoughts, as if the word is being weighed... accepted. It doesn't feel natural to her, you can sense it. "...was once unknown to me... as was much of what unfolded in the outside world. 

"When the curse came upon us... I thought it a... smaller thing, a thing of communities and hearths..."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>54</ID>
      <DefaultText>Her thoughts seem to stumble, as if on weak legs.

"...it was only when I... walked... did I feel it stretching out around me... in all the cracks of the world.

"Children have... been cursed. I do not think it was something they caused, nor something deserved. That which is inside them has been torn away... I do not know how, but this wound must be stitched closed. "</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Do you know its cause?"</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>57</ID>
      <DefaultText>There is a desperation, a welling fear... you can almost feel her thoughts shivering... and you realize she is as lost as you are on the matter... and then a sudden, sharp clarity.

"I shall know it. Through you."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>58</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Your eyes will track the cause, find the path, and I will be beside you. There is no wound that cannot be healed, and if you are truly a Watcher... then this wound may be seen for what it is.

"You saw me where I hid. Whoever's hands have stilled the world... you shall see them, too."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />

    <Entry>
      <ID>59</ID>

      <ID>61</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I will be there, and you WILL do what must be done. You were given your sight so that you may watch the world... and you will tend it.

"The children shall have their voice again. If your will is weak, then I shall strengthen it."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Lean upon me." You feel a weight in her words, as if her hands are on your shoulders. You feel the questions in your mind lose their edge... and become merely words. "As I lean upon you." 

"You shall be my eyes - as I shall be your hands when the time comes."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Those titles are markings on a map, and channel people's minds... in violent directions. 

"Such things are... a threadbare blanket cast over the world where men and women seek more importance than simply being."</DefaultText>

      <ID>65</ID>
      <DefaultText>"The world is a field of souls, tilled by Berath's Wheel. The... thought of cultures and territories do not concern me. The sowing and harvest of the field does.

"Berath's Wheel has slowed, perhaps stopped altogether. Whatever words, titles, laws, and blades not devoted to carving away the harm - or healing that wound - holds little importance for me."</DefaultText>

      <ID>66</ID>
      <DefaultText>There is a slow chill, and for a moment, it seems as if she is going to fade from your vision... then there is the sound of the chimes bound on her wrist, as she reaches out to the air in front of you, as if grasping it... then pushing it aside.

"I... have traveled far, so far that even the memory of such a place is... distant."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>67</ID>
      <DefaultText>Past the words, the chime echoes in your head, and it seems to echo again... as if falling down a long stone crevice... and never reaching the bottom. The chill persists for a heartbeat longer... then fades.

"The memory is lost. But I do not feel as if the memory I hold is... the same as home."</DefaultText>

      <ID>73</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Then... I suppose we must tend to each other as best we can. And endure. Your question carries wisdom, Watcher - to do further harm in an effort to heal the irrevocable would be a great tragedy, indeed."</DefaultText>
