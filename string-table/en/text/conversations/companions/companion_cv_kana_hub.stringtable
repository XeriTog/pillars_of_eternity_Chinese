      <DefaultText>"It's good to be on the road again. A wanderlust is nothing rare in the people of Rauatai, but often I think myself alone in loving the land as much as the sea."

      <DefaultText>"Hm. What shall I tell...? I am Kana Rua, born in the royal city of T&#226;kowa, from which rules the ranga nui. There, that is a solemn enough start." He grins brightly.

"I'm a lore chanter in the college there. Or at least a student of lore and a chanter both."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Invaders, I'm not so sure about. But perhaps I'm like the man who, being dry, throws off his rain cloak during a storm." Kana laughs. "So my mother would have me believe." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I confess, I was hoping our meeting with Maerwald would go a little differently. But then, you have gained an entire keep. I don't think I've seen anyone inherit land that quickly since Kyne the Younger read her father's will." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Kana studies you quietly, his broad shoulders set in a stiff line. "Perhaps Iovara did not have the final answer you sought, but still she revealed much." The edge of his mouth quirks upward in a pained smile. </DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>34</ID>
      <DefaultText>"A king. Our great king, ruler over all of Rauatai. He's led our people well. And he has treated my family very well. My father and he are great friends. ...As much as one can be friends, with a king." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"My two brothers have taken up my father's work, and my mother encouraged my sisters to sail. It leaves me free to pursue other things. There is a wealth of knowledge just within the walls of the college. And beyond it, more than I could learn in ten lifetimes." 

He laughs. "But I can try, all the same." </DefaultText>

      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>37</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Much as it sounds - a maze of walls, like the teeth of some nautical terror. It sits outside the city, and guards T&#226;kowa from invaders and storms. The storms have always been more trouble. Nuitanri - the angry titans, throwing themselves against Rauatai's shores." </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />

    <Entry>
      <ID>38</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Hm? Oh, them. Yes, I ran into them in Aedyr. Or rather, they sought me out. In Aedyr there were many people who had observed the Engwithan ruins in the Dyrwood, and I spent some time conferring with experts." </DefaultText>

      <ID>39</ID>
      <DefaultText>"My eldest brother thinks we spend our days in song, weaving wreaths from flowers. But the truth is far less exciting than that." 

"The college preserves what knowledge our people have gathered. I would have it said that the lore chanters are Rauatai, for without them, we would have no beginning - no sense of how far we've come. We would forget ourselves with every generation." </DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>41</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Ah, Rauatai. Shall I describe the pearl-white sands, the sapphire waters? The multi-hued tiles of the rooftops, like a mosaic upon the coast?"

Kana chuckles. "Sorry." </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>42</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Then talk turns to barring Aedyran and Vailian merchant ships, and..." Kana sighs. "Things were... difficult, when I left. There was much arguing among the elders. I trust the king has kept the peace - but I worry sometimes that things have taken a turn for the worse."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"The Tanvii ora Toha. It's not really a book - it's been passed down over the years in the form of a chant. I actually found it a little strange at first, seeing it set down in stone..." </DefaultText>

      <ID>54</ID>
      <DefaultText>"They haven't had much luck. The last one came up on me at a dig site, and slipped on a muddy beam. I tried to catch him - reflex, I should think - but he went right over the side, and down a hundred feet." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I was on the usual path at first - theology, the traditions - when the Gate of Great Teeth was completed. It was all my father had hoped for - the greatest commission he had ever received." </DefaultText>

      <ID>57</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Caed Nua is a marvel! An ugly, crumbling marvel, but even so. It's overshadowed by what it sits upon, but the keep itself can tell you much about the Aedyran settlement. A very rigid people, I find." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Copperlane? I suppose the jest is that you might as well be tossing your coin into the street as you walk. You'll find merchants here, along with blades for hire. The Goose and Fox is a fair tavern, if you'd like to rest a while." </DefaultText>

      <ID>61</ID>
      <DefaultText>"What don't I know!...Actually, quite a lot. There isn't very much known about the Endless Paths. By anyone, I mean. We're writing the history books as we speak. Or, er, walk." </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>62</ID>
      <DefaultText>"What I do know is that Od Nua is said to have been a great king, ruling over a host of men and women, and he built this place as a monument. But the Paths have been here two thousand years. The Aedyrans claimed it after them, and after them in turn came a host of treasure hunters and explorers. I'd wager there are bones down here for every era." </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>63</ID>
      <DefaultText>"All that time, dreaming of what the Endless Paths would be. I fashioned it into something grand, in my thoughts. A hidden kingdom, waiting under the earth for us to find it. What a fool I was!" </DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>70</ID>
      <DefaultText>Kana lets out a breath. "It did. I grant you that. A wise, noble society, and all its advances..." He laughs softly. "It called me all the way out here, to the Dyrwood. Imagine." 

"...We'd best get moving. This isn't the best place to talk." </DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>71</ID>
      <DefaultText>"No, they were not great. But nor were they worse than some." Kana's jaw tightens. "You'll have your wish. I won't lie for them, anymore." </DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>73</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Yes. If nothing else, there was a lesson in it." Kana sighs. "All that time, wasted on a foolish search. I might have wasted many more years yet."

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>75</ID>
      <DefaultText>Kana gives a startled laugh. "Treasure enough, certainly. But you saw those remains. If the Engwithans did this to their own people, how can I believe that they would favor peace?" </DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>80</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I suppose you're right. There are shameful deeds even in Rauatai's past... if not so large in scope." 

"Thank you, [Player Name]. You've given me much to think about." </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>81</ID>
      <DefaultText>Kana nods slowly. "A great statue... and a labyrinth, leading right into the heart of the world."

      <ID>82</ID>
      <DefaultText>Kana shakes his head, smiling faintly. "If the spirits complain, you can tell them they deserve far worse."

    <Entry>
      <ID>85</ID>
      <DefaultText>"That's not..." Kana's jaw works, and he finally looks away. "No, you're right. I came looking for an easy answer. Something that could guide us." 

"...I have to give this some thought. But thank you, for your words." </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>86</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I know the history, at least. This was where the War of Defiance came to an end. The district was once twice as large. They drained the wetland, and walled off the sea further out along the coast. A gift from Ondra, you see. A stretch of land claimed from the sea." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I wonder. I think the Dyrwood will be slow to call you thayn, or even Lord. Not that you don't deserve the titles. But these things are always complicated. Still, in practice, you are king of the keep." </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText>"I wonder. I think the Dyrwood will be slow to call you thaynu, or even Lady. Not that you don't deserve the titles. But these things are always complicated. Still, in practice, you are king of the keep. ...Or is it queen, here?" </FemaleText>

      <DefaultText>"He was far gone... But don't worry. The past is there that we might learn from it. I'm sure we'll find more answers in Defiance Bay." </DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>92</ID>
      <DefaultText>"This keep will give you a base from which to go searching, at least. And then, there are secrets still to be found beneath the great hall." He grins eagerly. "With you at the helm, it should be easier to explore the Endless Paths..." </DefaultText>
