      <DefaultText>"They, uh, heh, they did. 

"Was strange timing, 'cause we'd just won the war. They celebrated when I came home. There was music and dancing. Trumbel used half his grain making this big honey cake. I still dream about that cake. Like having the best lover of your life but only for one night.

      <DefaultText>"Raised that way. My family's been Eothasian going way back. Suppose it wasn't much of a choice at first.

      <DefaultText>"My younger days, I thought I was gonna go preach the word of Eothas. Just in our temple there.

"My parents encouraged it. I made so much trouble for them growing up, they used to say it'd be best if I got in good with the god of redemption."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>41</ID>
      <DefaultText>"'Course us blowing him up probably didn't help my chances there. But if anybody'd forgive you for blowing him up, it'd be Eothas."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>42</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Took a while for word of the Purges to reach us. Eothasians being murdered in the streets. Cold Morn and the like.

"No way would they let something like that happen in Gilded Vale. That's what they all said."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>43</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Caught me by surprise, after all the celebrating." 

He laughs. "Shoulda seen it coming after the tailor said he was gonna fit me for some new clothes, but then all he wanted was my neck measurement."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>44</ID>
      <DefaultText>"But the weeks went by and the Purges spread. Pretty soon they weren't so sure my brother fought for Dyrwood. Then they weren't so sure I did."</DefaultText>

      <ID>45</ID>
      <DefaultText>Edér pauses a moment, lost in thought. "The family whose farm I worked on, they had a little Hollowborn girl. When they heard the animancers had this cure - the Salvation, it was called - they went running."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>46</ID>
      <DefaultText>"This Salvation, they were putting animal souls in children. You might've heard about it. Giving them enough personality to care for themselves. 

"You can guess how that turned out. Matter of time, the children broke down, became wild things. Monsters."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>47</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Anyway, these farmers put their family dog's soul in their little girl. For a while the girl, she's making eye contact, she's feeding herself, albeit in a kind of messy way. 

"Then one day she snaps. They found her gnawing on her brother's bones. Had to chain her up, put her in a cow pen."

      <DefaultText>He shakes his head, and his eyes narrow, contemplative. "He was just waiting for his daughter to look up one day and recognize her papa."

"He was waiting for her to get better.

"Didn't understand that at the time, of course. But these days I think about him a lot."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>49</ID>
      <DefaultText>"The mother, she wouldn't have anything to do with the girl after that. But the father, he'd visit every day. Feed her chickens. Toss water on her once in a while to get the dirt off.

"Most of the village, they'd whisper about him. 'Poor man,' they'd say. 'Sick with grief.'"</DefaultText>

      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>51</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Been a long time since I've seen them. I really should visit, but for some reason I haven't much felt like leaving home.

"Good thing they chased me out or I might've never left."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>52</ID>
      <DefaultText>"My parents, they always let us be who we were. Never told me to be more like him or anything like that." He grins. "Which was good, because I was never gonna."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>53</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Not that he didn't get into trouble himself. He was just better about feeling guilty after.

"We used to have this farmer near us, Hereward. Couldn't stop talking about how well he cared for his chickens. How their feathers were the whitest in town. Convinced the butcher to pay him double what the other farmers got."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>54</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Me and Woden got tired of hearing it. I was maybe eleven, twelve at the time."

Edér grins widely at something remembered. "We, uh, we 'borrowed' about six different dyes from the dyer one night. Dyed Hereward's chickens every color but white."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>55</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Next morning, the butcher comes knocking, asking for six of his whitest chickens." Edér chuckles, beaming mischievous pride.

"We were feeling great, up until Hereward saw what we'd done. He just got on his knees and cried right there, all those colorful chickens around him not knowing what to make of it."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>56</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I thought it served him right, but I could tell Woden had other thoughts. Sure enough, the next day, every one of those chickens had been scrubbed down. They weren't white, mind you, but Woden sure tried. Never said a word to me about it, but I knew. That was Woden."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Eothas, he was a young man with a silver crown, carried a candle around with him."

He utters an amused grunt. "Sounds like I'm giving a bad eulogy here."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>58</ID>
      <DefaultText>"He was... well he was a lot of different things to different people, I guess. Rebirth, redemption. Light. 

"Out in the country, he's Gaun, the farmer, who helps all things pass, seasons and people both."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>59</ID>
      <DefaultText>"He watches over the weak, does Gaun. Sees imbalances made right. You could see why all the copperless rowdies around here might take a liking to someone like that. He was real popular here for a time."</DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>60</ID>
      <DefaultText>"These days you won't find too many worshiping Eothas in the open. It's hard to know who still does it in private and who's given up. Feels like I'm the last one sometimes."

He smirks. "If that's the case he deserves all the mourning."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>61</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Far as I know he hasn't said anything to anybody since the Godhammer detonated."</DefaultText>

      <ID>62</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Why worship him, then?"</DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>65</ID>
      <DefaultText>"That's not really it, though - not all of it, anyway." He casts a sidelong glance.

"Guess it's more I still believe in the things he believed in.

"I just hope his death doesn't mean the death of those things as well. Sometimes it looks that way."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>66</ID>
      <DefaultText>He grimaces. "Well, if it turns out he's NOT dead, and I gave up on him, I'd have betrayed my god twice. Even the god of redemption's gotta have standards. 

"I'd probably be reborn as a fat aumaua's horse."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>67</ID>
      <DefaultText>He looks you in the eye, conspiratorial. "Could just as well be that my ancestor did something so bad only Eothas could forgive.

"It'd explain a lot about where I got some of my less respectable traits."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>68</ID>
      <DefaultText>He shakes his head. "Hm mm. There was something I genuinely liked about Eothas. Always. Like he understood people better than the other gods. Knew all our flaws and weaknesses and accepted us for that.

"Folks are at their worst when they're afraid. A god like Eothas, he made you realize there was nothing to fear. Made you a better person."</DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>71</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Up to that point he was sticking up for his people. That's what Eothas does, least the Gaun part of him. Those farmers were starving and their government didn't lift a finger. I figured if it wasn't Eothas himself, at least he had the right idea."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>72</ID>
      <DefaultText>"But then he sent armies across the border. Even crossed it himself in the end. 

"Word was, he was chasing refugees that escaped the rebellion. Wanted to punish them, and punish us for allowing them to live here.

"That- that just didn't fit for me. Those are the deeds of a vengeful god. Skaen, or- or Woedica maybe."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>73</ID>

      <DefaultText>"It's eye-opening, seeing just how naked you are when you've got no god to protect you.

"The Saint's War was a hard time to be a Dyrwoodan. People thought it was the end times. They'd talk big about how we were gonna defeat a god, but I don't think there was a man from here to the White March didn't think he was gonna die."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>80</ID>
      <DefaultText>"It does something to you, thinking you're gonna die at someone else's hands. There's a rage that comes. Indignation.

      <DefaultText> "It was like the Legacy that way - no one knew the real reason, so they just picked whichever one best suited what they wanted to believe.

"Either way that town was burning before the first ashes of Eothas hit the ground. And it felt good to the people here, to be in control after being so helpless. So the fires spread. A lot of us Eothasians went the way of our god."</DefaultText>
