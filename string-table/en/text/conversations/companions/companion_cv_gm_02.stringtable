      <DefaultText>The peasant woman waits still. Her head is down, her face motionless, but you feel a thought welling up in her mind.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>This middle-aged peasant woman is dressed in a brown leather cloth draped down to her knees. Her hands are working at separating stringy, colorless vegetables in a pile before her, stripping the heads off the long fibrous stems with a paring knife.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />

    <Entry>
      <ID>7</ID>
      <DefaultText>She discards the stems one by one, placing the heads of the vegetables into a small cradle-like basket in front of her. She doesn't greet you as you approach. You're not sure she even knows you're there.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The woman doesn't respond, she keeps stripping the heads from the vegetables with a steady rhythm. She may be deaf - there's no indication she heard you.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>At first glance, she seems nothing more than a middle-aged woman, unremarkable, maybe less stern than most, who seems more focused on the weaving in her lap than her surroundings... yet you suddenly notice she's not stripping the vegetables before her any longer, she's weaving... and the vegetable pots are now missing.</DefaultText>

      <ID>15</ID>
      <DefaultText>She still pays you no mind, her brown locks torn and snagged from lack of washing, like many of the townsfolk you've seen. There is a strange blur to her... even the motions of her hands seem to be playing with threads that lack color... in a shape that lacks interest. </DefaultText>

      <ID>16</ID>
      <DefaultText>It may be that she is half-minded... or deaf... but something feels wrong. As you watch, her knitting takes on an odd cadence, and you have a terrible suspicion that something lurks beneath what your eyes are showing you.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Her brown hair is long, almost impossibly to the length of her hands... as you follow the streams of her locks downwards, the hairs become long and black, splitting off into threads of black and silver, and wrapping around her hands...</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>...she is forming a soul cradle with the threads, braiding a net in front of you, each finger long and sharp like a series of knitting needles... almost hypnotic.

      <DefaultText>...and suddenly, you are calm. You are on a plateau, almost the height of a tower, several stories high... the plateau is like a table lying beneath a clear sky, and beneath the plateau, surrounding it in all directions, a forest, hazy with mist... although whether it is actual mist... or distance, or a recollection. 

Resting in the curve of a natural arch above you is a great copper bell, half again the size of a man, hanging at attention, as if looking down on you and the event unfolding before you.</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>23</ID>
      <DefaultText>The plateau has soaked in the sun, and the rock beneath you is rough and warm. The sky forms a cradle around you... you feel different, not disembodied, but you feel your body, your physical contours have changed along with the surroundings...</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>24</ID>
      <DefaultText>...and you hear a soft series of chimes, like wind chimes. At the sound, the scene gains color and texture, as if the sound is beckoning you gently forth, filling your senses and thoughts, like mist roiling softly into a sealed chamber. And...</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>...weaving, not thread, but gathering, tenderly moving along the first movements of Berath's Wheel - your hands are wet... your hands are upon the flesh of a newborn child, and you can feel the crowning of a tiny head, turning in your grip, its head slick, wet from the womb.</DefaultText>

      <ID>29</ID>
      <DefaultText>The hands you are wearing, inhabiting, have done this many times, and they are practiced and confident.

Almost eagerly, the child comes forth, and as it does, your hands are in motion, weaving, weaving... moving along the length of a soft, wet rope... no, an umbilical cord from the legs of the naked woman before you... you are holding a small child, still wet from the womb, before you...</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The child cries out, its cry full of life... full of soul, the ringing of chimes echoing in its thoughts, filling it with its welcome. The soul is blurred at the edges, as if you are viewing a soul... from within a soul... but it is there. It is alive. The woman before you is weeping, and at her first cry, her hands reach out for it...</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>50</ID>
      <DefaultText>The chimes are intended to welcome the child, to be its first, gentle greeting into the world, a soothing sound guided by the tender motions of your wrists. You are helping to weave its thoughts, its perceptions, and the experience... the experience... </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>With effort, the scene bleeds of color, and your mind becomes your own again. There is no pull, no anchor, yet the sound of the chimes remains... as they existed in the memory, they sound here as well... and they are hanging from woven braids on the wrists of the woman before you. 

Even as your head is spinning from the touch of her mind, the sound of the chimes on her wrists is sharp and clear, as if coaxing you back to the real world.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The woman still sits before you, but she is nothing like what you first saw. She is wearing black, shredded garments that drape over her form like streamers. Her hair is streaks of black and run through with silver. Her age is almost impossible to tell... she simply feels old, like a crumbled watchtower... 

As she lifts her head to face you, you see that her hair is draped across the front of her face like a veil. </DefaultText>

      <ID>60</ID>
      <DefaultText>What you first saw of her was a mental glamour of some sort, unconscious, and you realize what you see is not what the world sees, and you are perhaps the first to see her true self. 

Still, you don't sense a threat in the realization... if anything, you feel a sense of relief from the figure. You can hear her thoughts, and she is glad to at last be seen.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>There is a light touch on your mind, a caress, and her left hand mirrors the motion of the touch, reaching up to the air between you. You hear the chime on her wrist sound, softly, her hand moves as if pantomiming resting on your cheek at a distance, and she speaks softly and slowly.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Your memories... a cadence of wheels on a caravan track, fever... questions by running water." She swallows, and the chime sounds as her hand shakes. "Violence in a night's campfire, arrows in the dark... and... fleeing, falling rock and cracking stone, and... a storm."

She stops, her hand frozen in the air. "The storm."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Her hand withdraws shyly, the chime sounding softly once again. The woman stands, uncertainly, as if she has been sitting for some time - or is too weak to bear her own weight.

      <DefaultText>There is a silence, and although it seems to last for but a heartbeat, in your thoughts, it stretches out between the two of you, like a pull between your minds.
