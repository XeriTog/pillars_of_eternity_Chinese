      <DefaultText>Hiravias thumbs his half-shredded ear and thinks to himself for several seconds.

"It wasn't uh... entirely by choice, not at the start, at least. My ambition was to be a hunter - I merely arrived by a different trail."</DefaultText>

"I'm excited we will be going to Twin Elms... nervous, but excited."</DefaultText>

      <ID>163</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I came to know Wael in earnest in the first year of my exile. I asked myself why Galawain would punish me for asking questions - what just and fair god would punish me for doing as he asks?

"Questioning why I had been mauled just drove me mad. At the height of my worry, I would have dreams where I only saw with my injured eye - my 'healthy' eye became blind in my dreams."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>A frown overcomes his face as he ponders your question. "Consider it a lapsed devotion. I will always respect the Seeker God, but he visited ruination on me when all I sought was knowledge - just as he taught it should be."

He meshes his fingers together and flexes his digits until the joints pop and click.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Wael is known as the Eyeless Face, so his symbol seemed a good fit for my eye patch."

He absent-mindedly runs his finger along the strap of the patch band. "Wael iconography is rather popular in my home tribe, but it seems he is not as widely venerated here in the Dyrwood."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"As a child, an anamfath came to visit. An honored guest is occasion for a grand chase, but I was left out... instructed instead to be cup bearer to the old wise one while the rest were on hunt."

"I'm sure you can guess what happens: wise anamfath gives dumb child a shred of attention. We ended up talking until the hunters returned."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"He gave me-" his hands dart across his body, scouring the pockets and folds of his tunic. "-this."

He presents a rusted iron medallion fashioned in the likeness of a hound's head - a common icon amongst the frontiersmen, explorers, and other seekers faithful to Galawain.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He looks at you, puzzled. "There are no cities to visit, no centers of commerce to explore - it would seem most visitors come to our lands to pillage the Engwithan ruins."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"The ancient Engwithans gave the forests to our ancestors and in return, we watch their ruins and see to it that they remain untouched.

      <ID>206</ID>
      <DefaultText>"See this?" He holds up the seed. "I know, just a seed - but I've never seen this type before and I'm itching to find out what grows from it. Every day I see something new out here. I'll return home eventually, but for now, my curiosity exceeds my nostalgia seven-fold."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"But I'm in their lands now and I will - in the interest of academic fairness - admit that I've met a few... several... decent... mostly non-rabid Dyrwoodans."

He looks askance and folds his arms. "But my suspicion about them all being drunkards has proved entirely accurate. I wonder what great wonders they'd accomplish if they all sobered up."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Hiravias spits. "Foreign looters obsessed with wealth and wine, may their bowels be obstructed with puss-weeping nodules - every one of them!"

His scowl lingers and he scratches at his ear stump. "Not that you're asking a neutral party. When I was an insufferable child, and I usually was, my parents told me Dyrwoodans would enslave me in this life and the next if I didn't behave."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"It's a long story and..." Hiravias shifts his weight from one leg to the next. "And I haven't really told it before to an outsider, so bear with me."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I struggled with spiritshifting - the final rite of passage in my druidic training. I prayed to Galawain for insight and, in the style of seekers of old, went to the forest - alone - to ask for guidance."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>254</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Then I got my answer." He shrugs. "An answer, at least... in the form of a vibrantly-colored stelgaer that pounced from the underbrush and made a salient demonstration of its capacity to eat things one-fifteenth its size."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"As the beast was lopping off bits of my handsomeness, I remember trying to fight back - swinging with arms too short to reach. I felt I had the energy for one last swipe at the beast's nose, and when I lashed out with a punch, my arm felt twice as massive and my fingers sprouted talons."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"In a rush of power I shifted into a mirror of my assailant. Apparently he couldn't pick on someone his own size. By the battle's end his severed arm was in my maw. The beast limped away in defeat."</DefaultText>

      <ID>265</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Aye, it only cost me half my face." His fingers play gently on his ear stump before a smile comes over his little face. "And for the record - the stelgaer limped home with worse!"</DefaultText>

      <ID>270</ID>
      <DefaultText>"The r&#238;ow of my circle believe the Autumn Stelgaer to be a heinous abomination - it is said that if it eats you, your soul is invariably lost. As this was my first and most intuitive form, they deemed me a carrier of its evil."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Hiravias stares at you with a frown before covering his face in his hands.

      <DefaultText>"No," he says with a huff. "It chose me - or so I imagine. I always assumed I would shift into a stoat - seems more true to my nature."

      <DefaultText>He lifts up the eye patch to gently itch at the socket - you catch a quick glimpse of a puckered and scarred abscess under the Wael-embroidered patch.

"So one afternoon I stitched a stylized eye motif on the patch. I like to think of it as my self-initiation rite into the brotherhood of Wael."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Hiravias smiles and scratches film of his teeth as he studies your reaction. "I'm being a brat. Truthfully, I think the guy is a lot more gentle than he pretends. He's certainly got a big heart for animals at least... which is rather telling of who he is under that soldier exterior."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"True enough," he says with a reluctant smile, "I suppose there's no harm in telling you all of this - just know that it's a touchy subject for me." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He shrugs. "I guess I haven't kept a close eye on her - not sure what to say. She seems harmless enough but... she must be glutton for trouble if she's traveling with us - she'd probably be safer on her own."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Hiravias nods to you with a smile. "A noble decision, my friend. I'm sure the temptation to use the souls for some selfish motive is an overwhelming one... but you did the right thing - each of those souls now has its own future, its own mystery to explore."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"A wise hunter does what it is necessary to preserve those alive in the here and now. The souls will strengthen all of us, and perhaps this will help those ravaged by the b&#238;a&#373;acs. Whatever comes next, we are all bettered by your actions."

Hiravias smiles and slaps your side. "It almost makes me want to overlook all your trespassing crimes."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Hiravias slaps you on the side with a beaming smile. "Victory looks good on you! There was a blur about your soul that lingers no more - seems putting Thaos to rest has given you some measure of inner peace."

He folds his arms in front of him and takes a deep breath. "Of course... now you need to decide what to do with these trapped souls..."

      <DefaultText>"So many hopes and dreams, all of them torn from the cycle and trapped for... for Wael knows how long!"

Hiravias scratches his chin and looks you up and down. "You could set them free - nowhere in particular - just free to go Wael knows where! Think of how many new lives and new journeys could start this very moment - it's all in your hands."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"You've won the right, if you wish, to use these souls as fodder to strengthen the living.

"Think of the Hollowborn, think of the victims of animancy gone awry... it would be a great boon to so many. Consider, my Watcher friend, that a true hunter provides strength and sustenance for the whole tribe."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"But that is merely my two pands on the matter. This is your hunt, your victory, your prize."

Hiravias bows, holding his lowered head for a long moment. "When I lost my way, you helped steer me back to Galawain. I sincerely believe the Seeker God has returned the favor by guiding you to this moment. It has been an honor to be a part of your pack."</DefaultText>
