      <DefaultText>Pallegina nods softly. "Back in the Republics, we call it the Frermàs mes Canc Suolias. The five suns are the 'ducs bels,' the great ducs who rule over the most powerful republics - Spirento, Ancenze, Selona, Ozia, and Revua."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"But my breastplate bulges in the wrong spot?" She cracks a small grin. "I may look like a woman and sound like a woman, but according to the Republics' laws, I'm not."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"What they call 'godlike,' people like me, we can never bear children, so we can't be 'real' women - for what that's worth. Most women in the Republics, if they can't bear children, it's like the sun has set on their lives."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"But what it was worth to me - freedom. The brotherhood has a prohibition against women entering, but I was allowed. Many resented the decision, but I learned long ago not to care."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>10</ID>
      <DefaultText>She throws her head back and laughs. "Ha ha ha! Of course not. They argue endlessly in the songretta ducala. The brotherhood is forbidden to take sides in their debates - not that I'd want to. I'd rather risk life and limb fighting the Republics' enemies than listen to the droning lectures of the ducal congress."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Our loyalty is not to individual ducs, but to the ducs as a whole, to their collective will and resolutions. We follow the mandates of the ducal congress. The individual ducs direct us, but they have an understanding of how we are not to be used."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>16</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Like with anyone who's different, most people are curious or afraid. And if they're afraid..." She shrugs, "...they get angry. They want to make sense of the world and people like me can be confusing."</DefaultText>

      <ID>17</ID>
      <DefaultText>"And believe me, people are easily confused." Her tone becomes more serious as her voice and gaze drift off. After a long moment, she looks back to you. "We all have to protect ourselves, no matter where we are. Being different means always looking over your shoulder, no matter what company you keep."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>19</ID>
      <DefaultText>She lets out a small laugh. "That's what they call me, yes. I've never met a god, so I don't know what they're like. I can't say why everyone else presumes to understand why I was born this way."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>22</ID>
      <DefaultText>"People look at the republics as a nation of traders. We do engage in much commercial trade through Defiance Bay, but the greatest value we have found is not written on a ledger line - it's intellectual wealth, the ideas that we exchange."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"The Dyrwood and the Vailian Republics are the world's leaders in animancy. If the Dyrwood institutes prohibitions against research and practice of animancy, it will have serious repercussions for the Vailian Republics."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Pirates attacked the town where my family lived. It was not uncommon when I was young. They were more of a nuisance than a real threat, but they were persistent enough that the duc of Ozia saw fit to send the Frermàs to deal with the threat."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>25</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I was enamored with the idea of being one of them. I didn't even know what it meant to serve a country then. I didn't really even know what the Republics were. I was just a little girl. But maybe I wanted to be them because I saw how people celebrated them. I saw how people thanked them for what they did. Most of all, I saw how they left - left this place that felt like a prison to me."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"My father resented me and my presence. When he learned that the brotherhood accepted my kind, because we are not considered women, he asked if I could be traded in exchange for taxes he owed on his land. The recruiter believed that having a 'Godlike' among the ranks would be prestigious, so he accepted in spite of my physical limitations."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I was born in a fishing village near Biageppe." Her brow furrows, her golden eyes looking away as she searches for a lost memory. "Can't remember the name."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>31</ID>
      <DefaultText>"The Vailian Republics are a rebirth of Grand Vailian culture, but we are more than just that. While Old Vailia was content to look ever backward, the Republics will shape the future."</DefaultText>

      <ID>35</ID>
      <DefaultText>"It was more difficult than I had imagined, but I was a child. Children fail to understand the true difficulty of things, but it makes them resilient to the doubt that plagues us in old age."</DefaultText>

      <ID>36</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Still, childhood eventually gives way to adolescence. It was then that the young men began to hate me for being different. Not 'Godlike', but a woman among them." She shifts uncomfortably. "For many years, it was hard to bear."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"It took me three tries to pass the physical tests required of all brothers. Such failures are not rare, but it was used against me up until the day I left. It wasn't until I entered service that I was able to escape the abuse."</DefaultText>

      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>39</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Because I was born different, but more than that, because the birth hurt my mother. It left her unable to bear more children." She weakly shrugs her shoulders.</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>41</ID>
      <DefaultText>"It's why my father traded me to the brotherhood. My mother... she was a different sort, kinder, more forgiving. She did not blame me for being what I was. But when my father looked at me, he saw his family line ended. He hated me for it."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>42</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I wish I had been born ordinary. I wish I had been born somehow different than I was. Or that I had been born somewhere, sometime where there was a place for me. But I was not.

"In the Republics, people look at me and they see a Godlike. I cannot marry, I cannot even practice a trade in most cities. My appearance is too upsetting to people."</DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>43</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Even though I could not be a part of that order, I saw the value in it. I thought that if I could help preserve the Republics', people would see that there is a place for my kind within our society. The ducs are good leaders, but they need the brotherhood to help them."</DefaultText>

      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>46</ID>
      <DefaultText>She snorts dismissively. "I'm not a scientist, but I believe animancy can benefit us all. There are so many questions to be answered about who we are - why I am the way I am. If we can answer them, maybe we can make life better for everyone."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>47</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Of course it's dangerous, but we who live in the Eastern Reach, we are the children of pioneers. We sought out the danger."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"The Old Vailians see grandeur in the acts of their forebears and believe it elevates them. They are a tired people from a fading time. There was once beauty in the great cities of the empire, but there are few alive today who ever saw it."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"They've done impressive things with cannon and artillery and some of their ship designs are interesting, but they shout too loudly over minor accomplishments." She smiles softly.</DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>59</ID>
      <DefaultText>"We used to view the empire as a threat. Since the revolution in Dyrwood, the Republics have benefited from the shield that the Dyrwood provides. It's another reason why I fear the fall of the Defiance Bay. If the Dyrwood is weak, Aedyr will surely test the Republics' dominance in the Eastern Reach."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>60</ID>
      <DefaultText>"It's not the Republics, but the Dyrwood is one of our closest allies. We trade more with the Dyrwood than any other nation and we have no greater ally in supporting animancy research."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>

    <Entry>
      <ID>64</ID>

    <Entry>
      <ID>65</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Your behavior is unbecoming. In the Republics, when one finds themselves in a position of overwhelming power, one is expected to exercise restraint. To treat people as badly as you do... " She shakes her head. "It speaks poorly of your character."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>66</ID>
      <DefaultText>"You are like these Dyrwoodans, always with a fire in your stomach looking to spit flames at anyone who gets in your way. There are times for fighting, but not all problems need to be solved with a sword."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>67</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Not so bad." She shrugs and thinks for a moment. "Still, it's good to speak one's mind, but take care you don't open it to everyone. There are times when discretion will take us further than honesty."</DefaultText>

      <ID>68</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I think it would go better if you didn't treat reason like a key that can unlock every problem that comes our way." She waves her finger at you with slight annoyance.

      <ID>69</ID>
      <DefaultText>Pallegina sighs and runs a hand over the feathers along the side of her face. "Not so bad, but you need to loosen up. If I'm going to fight across half the Dyrwood with someone, a little more conversation wouldn't hurt."</DefaultText>
