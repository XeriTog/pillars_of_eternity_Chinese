      <DefaultText>The marshal shakes his head. "Too green, and too few. If you go up against Lord Gathbin now, losses will be heavy. However, victory is still possible."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"It's as good as it can be, given the circumstances. With your willingness to spend coin, we should attract some veteran warriors, as well - they'll be useful for their experience and will help with morale if the situation becomes dire."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>17</ID>
      <DefaultText>"It is a delicate situation. Legally, Lord Gathbin's claim is just... and he knows it. Stripping land and title from a noble family is quite dangerous - perhaps more so than killing the man outright."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Enough. It's rumored Lord Gathbin will suffer a series of unfortunate and completely unforeseeable setbacks before his army is complete." He grins and winks. "Still, I'd not tarry long."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I've sent out a call for volunteers from the lands around Caed Nua. Hopefully, people will realize that being under your rule is preferable to that of Lord Gathbin's."

"Any hirelings stationed at Caed Nua will also accompany you to the battle, so I suggest you acquire as many of them as possible."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>27</ID>
      <DefaultText>"However, most of these men and women have no military experience. Hopefully you can gain additional allies. The Knights of the Crucible perhaps, or the Dozens."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I received a missive from the Doemenels." He frowns slightly. "They've heard about the situation and will send a squad of men when the time for battle comes. They were unclear about what kind of men they'll send, only that they're very good with their blades."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Believe it or not, but your friends in the Flames-That-Whisper clan have heard about your trouble with Lord Gathbin. Matron Beregan said something about a vision? In any case, a messenger from Stalwart said that Beregan is sending some of her clan to your aid."</DefaultText>

      <ID>34</ID>
      <DefaultText>He shakes his head. "No one has offered their help, I'm afraid. It may be possible to find an ally in Defiance Bay among the Knights of the Crucible, the Dozens, or if you're truly desperate, House Doemenel."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>35</ID>
      <DefaultText>He shakes his head. "Had you not made enemies all the major factions in Defiance Bay, you could've called upon one of them for help. A pity."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I've received word that Lord Gathbin is amassing an army of mercenaries near Yenwood Field. It appears a peaceful claim to Caed Nua is no longer possible."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>49</ID>
      <DefaultText>"With Gathbin dead, the erl only need worry about blood vengeance from family members that actually cared for Lord Gathbin. Those, if court gossip is to be believed, are few and far between."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>50</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Losing a family claim to land and title though? Such disputes incite hatred from the entire clan and their political allies, not to mention the unease it causes amongst the other nobles. Wars are started for less."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>51</ID>
      <DefaultText>"No. If Gathbin is to be denied, it will be you who must prove your legitimacy to the erl and all others who would dispute your claims. This is what is means to be noble in the Dyrwood."</DefaultText>

      <ID>57</ID>
      <DefaultText>"If we march now, we will assuredly be outmatched. Once our forces are committed, you won't be able to bolster them with additional troops or allies. Victory will greatly depend on you, [Player Name]. Are you certain you wish to march?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Lord Gathbin isn't fool enough to risk tearing down Caed Nua just to kill you, and if you shield yourself behind these walls, he'll have free rein to torment your subjects in the countryside."</DefaultText>
