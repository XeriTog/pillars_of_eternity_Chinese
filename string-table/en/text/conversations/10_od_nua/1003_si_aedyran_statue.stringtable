      <DefaultText>Judging by the style of clothing, and the cracked remnants of a beard upon the statue, [SkillCheck 0] suspects that this is the Erl of Yenwood. A lauded warrior, he was known to lead his men into battle, wielding a gleaming sabre.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Though old, the statue does not appear to have decayed as badly as some of the other objects in this place. The figure's attire is Aedyran in style, suggesting that the statue is a remnant from the Aedyran colonization.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You hear the rattling grind of some mechanism behind the walls at the statue's back. Closer by, the sound of scraping stone precedes a nearby wall shifting out of place to reveal a doorway. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You pull on the sabre, but it appears to be firmly lodged in the statue's grip. Further efforts risk damage to the blade - or cuts to your palm.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The stone figure is covered in fading scraps of its gilded coating. It seems to have once held something in its grip. From its stance, it was likely a weapon. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The sabre slides easily into place at first, but for the last short space you find yourself having to push. You hear a hollow clunk as the statue's forearm suddenly shifts and rotates. </DefaultText>
