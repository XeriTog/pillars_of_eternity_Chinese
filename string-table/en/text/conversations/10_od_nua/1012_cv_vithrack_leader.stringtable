      <DefaultText>You feel a scratching sensation in your head, followed by a sudden high-pitched ringing. Scattered images flash within your mind's eye: You see a mass of nests, set against a cavern wall, stretching up into the darkness. A vast network of webs, somewhere far beneath the surface. You see, too, the sentries you have recently slain, their bodies lying crumpled on the cavern floor.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The vithrack makes a peculiar clacking sound, and in your mind you feel a hazy gratitude. "Then Tcharek is grateful. Way to ruins lies east. Scouts have carved through stone. Found stairs. Found more than stairs. They guard us, now, from what is beneath."</DefaultText>
