      <DefaultText>"Who are you?" His voice seems to reverberate through the chamber. The mask's eyes burn with sudden new light, even as the room around you seems to grow darker. "Would you abandon your king? Take up your sword! To battle! The enemy has come."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"You forget the face of your lord?" Roiling eddies of darkness surge at the shade's feet, and it rises into the air, the glinting mask angling itself towards you. "No. Better to say that you see more clearly than my subjects." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Does your keep bear my name?" The mask tilts upwards, as if to look past stone and dirt and gaze upon the castle itself. "Will stone and mortar be my legacy?" Underneath the edges of Od Nua's mask, you see the dim fires flare. "When we have done the work of gods, and shaped men's souls?" </DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>30</ID>

      <DefaultText>There is a low, glottal sound of pain from behind Od Nua's mask. "I will never see him again. Even in death. We have been more wholly separated than if I had never known him. He will have forgotten me. Have I not paid? Have they not cost me all I had?" </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"The keep will not be yours while that presence remains. And you will not defeat it. The caverns will be filled once more. They will boil up the steps. All your kith and kin will die. Leave this place. Forget our names, while you are able." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I have tried!" His cry echoes through the chamber. "I cannot. The regret burns within me like fire. It eats all thought." As if in answer, fire laps at the edges of his mask, sending a wave of heat towards you. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The shade emerges like a wound in the world, split open to reveal a hollow darkness. Beneath a writhing crown of shadow lies a gleaming mask, bearing the visage of an older man. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"So many hours and days spent wondering. If I had been there but a moment earlier. If I had stopped him from leaving that morning. If I had only known that I would never see him again." </DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>59</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Or do you come to me now for answers? The key, at last, to your great tale? So that you might sit by fires and tell the new people of the world of what you have discovered, rooting through the bones of their forebears?" </DefaultText>

      <ID>66</ID>
      <DefaultText>Od Nua's voice gains a distant quality. "We sought the place where the veins of the world meet. Where a soul might be drawn from the adra. If we could find the means to keep the soul intact. To preserve its memory. We are so close. It is nearly done." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"It was lost long ago. This battle, and more." Roiling eddies of darkness surge at the shade's feet, and it rises into the air, the glinting mask angling itself towards you. "You are no lost soul of mine. No soldier."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"You are no subject of mine, to be so bold. No lost soul, no soldier." The shade's voice gains a cold and sour note. "Do you come for riches? For what gold you may peel from dead graves?" </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>74</ID>

      <DefaultText>"My people shaped for me a titan, vast and wondrous in form, so that it might be worthy of the soul that would dwell within it." He reaches out a hand, pointing a dark and tapering claw towards the steps. "I have not... looked upon it, since..." </DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>87</ID>
      <DefaultText>"...Many souls do pass, from time to time, into this place. The adra draws them deep, and there they are consumed." The mask turns towards you once more. "But not by me." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"This... chamber, I recall. The final moments. And in recalling them I am returned to my power. It is... tempting, sometimes, to remain thus. To be some semblance of a king." </DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>89</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Something dwells in the place beneath us, and there feeds upon my people - as it did when we drew breath. It is an old, ancient thing, and you will not conquer it, any more than we could conquer ignorance."</DefaultText>

      <ID>90</ID>
      <DefaultText>Od Nua suddenly shudders, and the shape of him seems to warp and twist. The tines of his dark crown grow long, and the surface of his mask ripples like molten ore. </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>91</ID>
      <DefaultText>The mask turns toward you, streaks of golden fire running from its eyes. "None walk there save Od Nua's line. You will not tread in that place. Not there." </DefaultText>

      <ID>97</ID>
      <DefaultText>"...If not that I remember all else, too. The hurt of dying. The loss, I feel as keenly as on the day my son was taken from me. Should such things, too, not be claimed by time?

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>101</ID>
      <DefaultText>"For a fleeting moment. I would have saved them all, in time. We might have plucked them from beyond the Shroud as easily as we cast them through it. We might have halted the wheel altogether." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"They will destroy all that I have worked for. They will steal my only hope." Od Nua raises his arms, now lashing tendrils of shadow. "Will we allow the rabble to strike us from this world? To steal my son from me a final time?" </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"That my son might, from one moment to the next, be lost to me, is... abomination." His voice thickens with grief, reverberating through the chamber.
