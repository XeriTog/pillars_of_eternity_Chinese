      <DefaultText>As Danna tallies your payment, several armed figures enter the room. You don't recognize the Crucible Knights, but the Vailian looks strangely familiar, and you realize that you've stumbled across him in Ondra's Gift and, more recently, in Copperlane. "Danna Doemenel, caught in the act. Your father would be displeased to see you conducting business so clumsily."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Antonino walks with a swordsman's swagger. An elaborate basket hilt of intertwining gold and silver protrudes from his belt. He nods at your approach. "My friend, it is good to see you again."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Danna snarls. "Calling the Crucible Knights is hardly subtle. Is this how Mestre Verzano usually deals with competition?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Meet me at Verzano's warehouse. If I know the Doemenels, they're planning an attack." His chest heaves and there's a sheen of perspiration on his forehead. He grins as if he's looking forward to the coming battle. "We could use your help if you're willing."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Danna's bruisers have already drawn their weapons. She turns to you. "Antonino and Verzano are hardly the virtuous businessmen they'd like you to believe. I'm guessing they used you to entrap me."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He bows, sweeping a leg out in front of him. "I am Antonino, swordsman from the Vailian Republic of Ancenze." He pats the elaborate hilt of his blade. "I defend the Vailian Trading Company's interests in Defiance Bay, as you have seen."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Do you reveal your hand to your opponents in a game of cards?" He shrugs. "In the Republics, we see things differently. Sometimes, this 'forthrightness' gives offense. Sometimes, a little shrewdness avoids bloodshed."</DefaultText>
