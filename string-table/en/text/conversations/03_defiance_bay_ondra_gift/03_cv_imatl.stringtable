      <DefaultText>He shows you the object in his hand. It's a large, round opal with Engwithan runes carved into it. It glistens with his sweat.

      <DefaultText>"You find the missing pieces of the artifact, and I've got an animancer friend from my expedition days who'll find you a stack of coppers." He scratches his beard. 

"All I want out of this is a few hundred pands for my lost payday. If that sounds fair to you, I'll give you this stone and the name of my contact once you have everything else."

Imatl regards the opal again. "Seeing as the kid dredged this stone up in his net, I'd wager you could probably find the missing pieces out in the shallows during low tide."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>An old man paces the dock and looks out over the water. He's fussing over something large and round, which he constantly shifts from one hand to the other. 

You're not certain whether his wide-eyed, gape-mouthed expression marks surprise or fear. It seems he isn't, either. "You, uh, don't look like a guard..." He examines you - and your equipment - more closely. "Say, you wouldn't be interested in making some coppers, would you?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>A scowl crosses his leathery face. "Drunk more often than sober, and poor company either way. He spends his scant coin at the Salty Mast when he's got mouths to feed, and yet he thinks his Hollowborn daughter is the curse on his family."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He frowns. "That boy loves the ships. He's probably playing pirates with the sailors. If he hasn't stowed away with the cargo."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"It's part of that scepter. From what I recall, there were three other pieces, and I'd bet you anything they're somewhere in the shallows, too. If anyone could find them, there'd be profit to follow."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>110</ID>
      <DefaultText>He spits into the water. "I'll be glad to sail with captains who're more careful about their cargo from now on. I don't give a wurm's wings about the duc's trafficking laws, but I'm too old to fight ancient horrors."

He takes a deep breath of the salty air. "I just want to enjoy my twilight years doing an honest day's work."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>His bristled eyebrows rise to a peak. "You mean you got past those armored monsters? I don't know how..." He shakes his head.

"Listen, if you're willing, I'll give you this last piece." He holds up the opal. "And the name of someone who'll buy it all. All I want is two hundred pands for getting the cargo here. Sound fair?"</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>122</ID>
      <DefaultText>He sighs. "Come back if you change your mind. Looks like the Lady of Lament is keeping the rest of the scepter for now."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He scratches his sunburned scalp. "We've got docks, fishing, and steady ship traffic. All this..." He waves at the listing shanties crowded against one another. "This sprang up around the docks. It's the poorest district in Defiance Bay, but one of the liveliest."

He grins. "And for lively, nothing beats the Salty Mast. You'd do better to ask a younger man than me if you want to know about that place." He nods toward a large, round building to the east.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I saw one of those suits of armor, walking around all by itself. It was covered in blood. When it saw me, it started running for the hatch. So I closed it." He squeezes his eyes shut.</DefaultText>

      <ID>142</ID>
      <DefaultText>He rolls the stone between his hands. "I'm just a deckhand, but I was the only one left. I piloted the ship as best I could, but I hit rocks as we were passing Brackenbury. I barely made it to Ondra's Gift before I had to jump overboard and swim for the docks.

"I'd given up on the cargo - not to mention the payday - when one of the lads pulled this up in his nets." He shows you the opal again.</DefaultText>

      <ID>143</ID>
      <DefaultText>He sighs. "I'll take anything at this point."

He accepts your money and gives you the opal. It's still warm from his hands. "You'll want to go to the Brackenbury Sanitarium and find Nans. She'll know more about this artifact, and I know for a fact she's bought others from our crew before."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He shoves the opal, still warm from his hands, into yours. "Take it." His mouth withers into a sullen frown. "And look for Nans at the Brackenbury Sanitarium."

      <DefaultText>"Well, you should know, shouldn't you? From your accent, I take it you're from the Ixamitl Plains, too. They're just another kind of ocean when you think about it. Places where you can stand and see nothing on the horizon but the wind making waves in the grass."

He watches the surf lapping against the wrecked boat. "And perhaps this is the gods' way of saying that people like us should never have taken to the water."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>166</ID>
      <DefaultText>"That's because it isn't. I'm from the Ixamitl Plains, a broad savanna north of the Dyrwood. Not so different from the ocean, in a way. There are places where you can stand and turn a full circle and see nothing but the winds making waves in the grass."

He watches the surf lapping against the wrecked boat. "But at moments like this, I wonder what business a plainsman like me had taking to the water."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>167</ID>
      <DefaultText>He closes his hand around the opal in a white-knuckled grip. "We were almost to Defiance Bay when the screaming started. I've seen my share of barroom brawls, but this sounded different. I was topside with the captain, but he and the first mate went belowdecks to see what all the commotion was about. When they didn't come back, I looked into the hold." He shudders.</DefaultText>

      <ID>168</ID>
      <DefaultText>He massages the opal in a clammy palm. "When we reached Eina's Rest, we may have agreed to, uh, take on a few crates from some place called Clîaban Rilag. A couple of the lads snuck a peek at the cargo. Saw suits of armor and a broken scepter." 

He shrugs. "Don't know why anyone would want a broken anything, but these animancers'll buy dirty stockings if you say they came from the ruins."</DefaultText>
