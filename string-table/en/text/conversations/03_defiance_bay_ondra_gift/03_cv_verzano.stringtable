      <DefaultText>A man stands in the corner of the warehouse, directing traffic. Gems wink from the many rings on his fingers as he points and waves at the laborers. 

His silk clothes, though finely embroidered, aren't new - you notice a couple mended seams around the shoulders and a discreet patch on one elbow.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Ah, I see you are back! No doubt you have come for the delivery job. Work in Defiance Bay is hard to come by these days, yes?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He wipes the sheen from his forehead and looks around the warehouse with the wide, fearful eyes of a hunted animal. "I can't thank you enough, aimico. But this won't stop the Doemenels for long. I've got to get out of here, and I recommend that you do, too."

He hands you his pistol and gives you a bag of coin with shaking hands. "That's all I have after this ill-fated venture. Thank you again, and please, look out for yourself."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He tugs at his beard. "I must assume, then, that you are not from the company I contacted at the expedition hall." He waves a hand. "But you are here, and they are not."

"It is a bag of bitter squash seeds, which are prized for their medicinal properties. Few merchants in Defiance Bay deal in them, but those who do know their value."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>When he sees you, he throws his arms wide in an expansive welcome. "Greetings! You have come to the warehouse and headquarters of the Vailian Trading Company." 

He consults a pocket watch. Some of the gold filigree has chipped away. "But you are late! I sent word to the expedition hall yesterday. This delivery cannot wait." He snaps the watch shut.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I am a merchant from Ancenze, the fairest of the Vailian Republics. Here in Defiance Bay, I run the Vailian Trading Company."

He gestures at the stacked crates. "We ship cargo to and from the Republics. We are part of the grandest mercantile organization in the world. Anything you can imagine, we can ship it." He grins. "For a fee."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He claps his hands together. "Excellent! Now, deliver this package to a man named Gareth at the Goose and Fox in Copperlane. He will know what to do with it." He slips a bag of pebbly seeds into your hand.

"Return to me when you are done, and I shall see to your payment."</DefaultText>

      <ID>50</ID>
      <DefaultText>"We are a confederation of merchants and traders from the Republics." He looks proudly around the warehouse. "We sell all manner of goods and equipment, and for years we've enjoyed fruitful contracts with many shops, inns, and armorers throughout Defiance Bay." His smile flickers.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Let me ask about something else."</DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>53</ID>
      <DefaultText>"It is nothing." He waves a hand. "Only that competition has grown especially fierce in recent months. But I suppose this is to be expected given the Legacy, as the locals call it."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"You'd better explain why you sent me into a trap. And fast."</DefaultText>

      <ID>56</ID>
      <DefaultText>"If you'd told me the Doemenels were after you, you could have saved us both a lot of trouble."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"How can I trust you after the way you manipulated me?"</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>58</ID>
      <DefaultText>"You didn't tell me things would get messy. I charge extra for that."</DefaultText>

      <ID>64</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Seems simple enough. Why ask me?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>A frown distorts his meticulous goatee. "My own couriers have been robbed and beaten these past weeks. It would seem that some of my competitors resent my success. In any case, you are not a known associate. You would be left alone. And if not..." He shrugs and grins. "You look like you could handle yourself.

"And as for your integrity, I suppose I will just have to trust you. As you will have to trust my assurances that you won't find a buyer outside of my contact."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"The Doemenels were there?" Verzano's eyes fly open, and he tugs at his beard. "I was so careful, always following the verlavita. They couldn't have known..."</DefaultText>

      <ID>73</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Ah, you must mean Pallegina. She's a paladin in the employ of the Vailian embassy." He chuckles. "She's a good soldier, but not so good at taking orders. Too hot a temper, I'm afraid."</DefaultText>

      <ID>74</ID>
      <DefaultText>"She seemed angry."</DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>76</ID>
      <DefaultText>He laughs again. "That is no surprise. She's hotheaded. A woman in a brotherhood of paladins, and touched by the gods in such an unusual way."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Verzano checks his battered pocket watch. "Better deliver that package, no? Business such as this is best concluded quickly."</DefaultText>

      <ID>79</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I'm sure you can also see I've no time to bother with her tantrums."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Like you, I am a merchant. But I am from Ancenze, the fairest of the Vailian Republics. Here in Defiance Bay, I run the Vailian Trading Company."

"Besides, all of Defiance Bay knows of your integrity. And you will have to trust my assurances that you won't find a buyer outside of my contact."</DefaultText>
