      <DefaultText>A young boy's corpse lies at your feet, half-covered in dirt and seaweed. His hands have stiffened around a dagger. A soul lingers nearby, something confused and lost in the seaside fog.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>As you reach for the soul, it lashes out. Glowing mist strikes at the air around you. The soul can't touch you, but you feel it burn with a feeble, uncontrolled rage.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The boy's small hands are rigid in death, but you pry the dagger free. It looks too large, and too expensive, to have belonged to him. The letter "B" is carved into the pommel.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The soul flickers. It ripples toward you, timidly at first. As it swirls around you, you experience wonder, fear, and the joy of running between the ships at noon. With a jolt, it pulls you into the streets around the Salty Mast.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Women with painted faces weave between men stumbling in and out of the lamplight. Father's gone in for a drink, just like always. He said he'd only be a few minutes, but it's been hours. The man guarding the door only laughed when you tried to explain this.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>There's always a back door. In an alley, two men have cornered a woman. Her cheeks are streaked with tears. She's backed against the wall and looking away. They're inching closer.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You step forward. The men barely acknowledge you. But the woman looks at you, a plea in her eyes. You've seen that look in abused strays. In your Hollowborn sister, that time Father took her from her splintering cradle and to the filled washbasin. You were brave that day.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>A knife is in the thug's belt. It's in your hands. And now it's in his thigh. You're small and fast, but not fast enough. Fingers bite into your arm and a muddy boot sails toward your face. Then, everything is muffled by cold, brackish water. </DefaultText>
