      <DefaultText>The woman looks like she hasn't slept in days. Her hair is a rat's nest of tangles, and her eyes are lined with shadows. She casts an anxious glance at the door.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I'd be out on the docks and looking myself, but I can't leave the baby." Her eyes wander to a crib, and she lowers her voice. "I don't dare take a Hollowborn out, what with the violence near the brothel."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The ghost of a smile flickers across her lips. "He's a brave lad, if a little too bold for his own good. But he's always been a dutiful son and a gentle brother. He's got dark hair, quick eyes, and a ready smile. When you find him, you'll recognize him in a heartbeat, I'm sure of it."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>17</ID>
      <DefaultText>She scowls and brushes a greasy strand of hair from her face. "Sometimes I don't know whether to rejoice or rue that he comes home as often as he does. He spends most of his time and all of our money drinking at the brothel. Has ever since..." Her gaze returns to the silent cradle.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Odda closes her tired eyes, likely for the first time in two days. "I don't know how to thank you. I don't have much to spare these days, but Ondra bless you for anything you can do."</DefaultText>

      <ID>31</ID>
      <DefaultText>She turns her gaze to the filthy, jagged flagstones. "That... does sound like him. I wish he'd said goodbye." She regards the Hollowborn in the cradle. "Still, if he can find a better life, I'm grateful. It's what every parent should want, I suppose."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Odda turns to the motionless child in the cradle. Her eyes are dewy, but her mouth is set in a firm line.</DefaultText>

      <ID>39</ID>
      <DefaultText>Odda's eyes are bright, and her cheeks are ruddy and wet. "Weyd told me what happened to our son." She sniffs and wipes at her tears. "I almost threw him out. Still might. But he swears he'll be a better father to this one."</DefaultText>

      <ID>41</ID>
      <DefaultText>"That good-for-nothing told me that our son left." She shakes her head. "And now he's back at that brothel. I can only hope Derrin has something brighter ahead."</DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>45</ID>
      <DefaultText>The answer is etched plainly on her face. "Waidwen's Legacy is as potent in Defiance Bay as anywhere. People are scared, and they're looking for someone to blame, whether it's those women at the brothel or the families of these poor babes."</DefaultText>

      <ID>46</ID>
      <DefaultText>She sighs and watches the motionless cradle. "I don't approve of what goes on at Maea's place, but these attacks won't earn us the gods' mercy. And it's only made it harder to earn a living."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Odda's mouth falls open, and she stares back in shock. "My boy's dead? That... can't be. What happened?"</DefaultText>

      <ID>52</ID>

      <DefaultText>"Gods, how could this make it any better? I would never have let my boy die for one of those... women. And yet..." She chokes into her sleeve. "I can only pray the gods will be kinder to him in the next life. Maybe there's hope for one of my children."</DefaultText>

      <ID>59</ID>
      <DefaultText>After several seconds, she closes her eyes and swallows. "I suppose it's better to know the truth than to keep wondering. Thank you, at least, for bringing me answers."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"No, I... I suppose not." She sniffs and wipes at the tears on her cheeks. "Maybe it's better to remember him the way he was. Young, happy, and full of life."</DefaultText>

      <ID>65</ID>
      <DefaultText>She stifles a wail behind her sleeve. "I took that man back so many times! I forgave him every time he emptied our coffers, I believed he could change one day."</DefaultText>
