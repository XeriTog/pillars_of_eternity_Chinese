      <DefaultText>The aumaua woman watches you suspiciously. One hand is tensed at her side, but as you approach, she relaxes and gives you a friendly, if weary, smile. "I don't see many outfitted like you who aren't looking for trouble. You aren't looking for trouble, are you?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>A frown ripples across her blue facial markings. "The kind that's bad for business. Local rowdies have taken to harassing my hard-working boys and girls. And our customers.

      <DefaultText>"Might as well have a drink or two. This seems like as good a place as any to pick up a few sordid secrets. And, er, sundry diseases, at that..."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"So many minds here... filled with lust, gaiety... but also with worry, heartache, terror..."

She looks around at the talking, laughing, drinking crowds. "These rooms have been filled by despair at the Hollowborn as much as by anything else..." Her gaze returns to Maea. "A shame that one would so readily profit from it."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Defiance Bay hasn't seen a battle like that since the Aedyrans left. At least this one didn't take the Gift."

She looks at the patrons and prostitutes in the bar. "Too soon to say what this really means for us, I suppose."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"What else am I supposed to do? I have to provide certain... measures for my employees and their clients, especially with so many Hollowborn in the district. And with the price of bitter squash as high as it is, I've got no choice but to raise mine."

      <DefaultText>"I should've known better than to turn to a friend of the Dozens. Empty-headed agitators, all of them." Her eyes flit to the guards on patrol. "Fine, I'll lower the damn prices. I'd rather take a hit than have a bloodbath."

She glares at you. "Now, I'm sure you have something better to do."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She looks you up and down, scratching her chin. "I've been looking for someone to help me clean things up around here, and word on the street is that you know how to take matters into your own hands. The Knights are too busy sniffing around Duc Aevar to bother with us commoners in the Gift, and I'd just as soon not deal with their bureaucracy anyway."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She looks you up and down, scratching her chin. "There aren't too many who care about what happens in places like the Gift, but word is you're an exception.

      <DefaultText>There is a look in Durance's eyes like a lion that has stumbled upon a herd of deer. His knuckles are white as he clutches his staff with both hands as he surveys the room. He laughs to himself, low and rumbling.</DefaultText>
