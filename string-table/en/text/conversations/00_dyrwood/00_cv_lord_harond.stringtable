      <DefaultText>"We'd stopped in Dyrford for a few days. On our fourth evening here, I was making plans to continue our journey. Lady Aelys was feeling unwell and went to bed. When I retired a couple hours later, I found that she had vanished. None of my men had seen her go, and no one at the inn knew where she was.

      <DefaultText>He frowns as if about to protest, but he gives in with a sigh. "Lady Aelys has reached an age where it is... prudent for her to marry.

      <DefaultText>He gasps, his eyes widening in horror and outrage. He yanks a coin purse from his belt and drops it into your hand. "I don't know what foul rumors you've heard, but my family is one of the oldest and noblest in Defiance Bay.
