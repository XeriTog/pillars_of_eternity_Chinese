      <DefaultText>As you advance into the darkness, the ground begins to tremble. You hear plodding footfalls, growling breaths, and bone-snapping crunches.

An ogre steps out of the shadows, ten feet tall and bulging with muscle. He tears a mouthful from a hoofed, pink-fleshed limb and tosses it aside.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Korgrak's snarl reveals a row of large, stained teeth. "I've done my best to avoid kith. Especially the kind that might give rise to search parties."

He scratches his knuckles and eyes you. "She never came here. Of that I'm sure."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He grits his teeth and glares at you, his eyes hard and narrow with rage. Korgrak takes several heaving breaths, seemingly ready to charge at any second.

Finally, he drops his club. 

"That's what I was afraid of." He sighs, blasting you with his fetid breath. "Time to move on, then."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Hiding from your kind." He scratches a tusk, glaring at you. "Kith driven from their homes by strange storms. Bandits out for blood and coin. My kind is unsafe around kith at the best of times, but now? Tempers run hot, and ogre blood is valued among your alchemists."

      <DefaultText>"Sell my services for the shelter of a fortress? Sounds like another kind of trouble, but perhaps one I can handle."

      <DefaultText>He watches you from under the thick ridge of his brows. "Too well-equipped to be a villager. A bandit from the road, then. Must be."

The ogre snorts and tightens his grip around a club. "I've kept to myself. Killed no one but the fools reckless enough to chase me down here. Why have you come looking for me?"</DefaultText>

      <ID>46</ID>
      <DefaultText>He smashes his club into the ground. "You think I haven't looked? I've wandered the wood from the Isce ÃŽen to here. A spider-filled cave is the best hiding spot I've found yet."</DefaultText>

      <ID>47</ID>
      <DefaultText>He smashes his club into the ground. "I told you! The kith on the road these days hunger for anything they can eat or sell. I wouldn't last a week wandering the open. Not by myself."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Funny you should ask - remember how I was mentioning Twin Elms when we first met? From what I've been told, a few ogres live there - and not as servants or slaves."

Hiravias shrugs and smiles in Korgrak's direction. "I don't think the druids will take well to being eaten, but maybe Korgrak can play nice?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Heard once from a traveler that out in Twin Elms they had some ogres living peaceful next to kith.

      <DefaultText>"You know, the Glanfathans are a little more tolerant of ogres. I've heard of a few living among them in Twin Elms. If... this one can behave peacefully, he might do the same."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>A smile stretches to his tusks. "Quiet. Stealthy. I think I see what you mean."

      <DefaultText>A smile stretches to his tusks. "You think I should make an example and a meal out of him? The idea is not an unwelcome one."
