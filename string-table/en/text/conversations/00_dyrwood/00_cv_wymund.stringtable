      <DefaultText>A large, bull-necked man in a hood helps a young elven woman down from a glass chamber connected to a dizzying array of cables and machinery. Her skin and clothing glisten with fresh blood.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You reach out to Aelys, seeking the dark crevices of her mind. The essence of a hundred vindictive souls clouds her psyche, and you clear it the only way you can - by ripping out the horrifying memories to which they've attached themselves.

It's taxing work, and some of the souls lash and sting at your mind.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Dozens of voices hiss in rage and despair. You work faster and faster, uprooting thoughts and images of a man Aelys once knew as family. As you tear through the tangles of memory, leaving the shredded remains to waft away and dissipate, you hear the sobbing of a lonely, scared girl at the middle of it all.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The Grieving Mother bows her head. "Thank you, Watcher."

You feel her reach out, persistent yet gentle. Aelys does not move, but the Grieving Mother trembles with exertion, and the air around her rings with the sound of chimes.

At last, she collapses, her energy spent. The strain throbs in her mind.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>For just a moment, Aelys' eyes close. When they open again, her expression is blank. But as she takes in the scene before her - you, Wymund, and the machinery in this strange, dark room - her confusion turns to fear. She lets out a choked cry.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The hooded man slowly looks you over. "His ways are subtle, indeed. I've tweaked the ritual of the Effigy with animancy to make it more... predictable. The girl will return to the village and continue her journey with Harond..."

      <DefaultText>He nods. "Return to Dyrford above and see that Harond continues onward with her. Neither of us shall witness Aelys' vengeance, but if all goes as planned, the whole of the Dyrwood will hear of it." He nudges the young woman forward.</DefaultText>

"The charged essence of dozens of maltreated slaves and underlings is already taking root in her mind. Once it's established, it'll drive her to murder her uncle, her aunt, and anyone foolish enough to get in her way. People won't be able to look away from Harond's sins then."</DefaultText>
