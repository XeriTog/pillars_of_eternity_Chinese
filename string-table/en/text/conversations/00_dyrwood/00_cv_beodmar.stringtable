      <DefaultText>The old man turns as you enter. His face is covered in bruises and his lower lip is swollen. "Out with you! I already told you what-" 

He stops and peers at you, squinting through a black eye. "I'm sorry, I thought you were one of those ruffians."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I'm afraid not. Lord Harond's men already asked me, and that was the first I'd seen of any of his party."

He holds a hand to his heart. "Wherever she is, in this life or another, I hope he takes comfort that her soul is with Berath."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The old priest tugs on his beard and frowns. "The Glanfathan tribe that guards the ruins will kill anyone who trespasses there, and they'll retaliate against us, too, if history is any indication.

"We've had too many fortune-seekers stir up trouble of late. If I'm to tell you, I'll need to know your reason for wanting to go."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>A weary sigh wheezes out of his throat. "If that's the case, then we may already have trouble headed our way. I'll have to take you at your word."

He pulls out a faded map and points to a spot in the woods. "You'll find Cl&#238;aban Rilag here. Whatever trouble you find there, please, end it quietly. And try to stay out of the ruins..."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He shrinks back, scowling under his bushy eyebrows. He licks his lips. "Berath forgive my cowardice." He pulls out a faded map and jabs at a spot in the woods. "Here. You'll find the ruins here. And may the creatures dwelling inside make short work of you."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The old priest's essence hovers among the dust motes filling the temple. As it envelopes you, you feel his resignation, even contentment, with whatever new fate Berath has chosen. Life and death are simply opposite spokes of the same wheel.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>But you also feel anxiety and foreboding at the center of this vague consciousness. Digging deeper, you find yourself staring at a familiar vision of a door in the mountain and two gargantuan reliefs.

Instinctively, you know the way to Cl&#238;aban Rilag. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He hobbles over to the filmy window. "I never saw their faces. Strange, hooded men asking about those ruins. Cl&#238;aban Rilag."

He peers through the dirty glass. "Most of the brigands who come through here asking about the ruins are looking for a few ancient trinkets. But these people knew the name. And they were in a hurry."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He folds his arms and stares at you with one eye and a scowl. "So this is where I say 'go into the ruins and I'll kill you' and that's when you say 'Hiravias, I'm a Watcher and you're no match for all of us and we've got a good reason for this' and then I give up trying to argue with you and leave you to dig your own trespasser's grave.

"And I'm only being half-metaphoric, we sometimes make Dyrwoodans dig your own grave before we kill you - when the kids hear about it's a fabulous deterrent."</DefaultText>

      <ID>145</ID>
      <DefaultText>"It has. Cities and villages all over the Dyrwood have seen Hollowborn, but Dyrford hasn't seen the birth of an unaffected child in years. Most of our people have moved on to other villages in search of hope, and those who have stayed behind aren't the same. Children promise a future, you know. People change when you take that away from them."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Berath is the most universal of all the gods. It oversees portals and cycles of all kinds, even life and death itself. Under Berath, an ending is merely a passage to another beginning. 

"Berath has many representations across time and across cultures. Around the Dyrwood, you'll commonly see it depicted as the Pallid Knight or the Usher. The Glanfathans, however, know it as Bewnen i Ankew and Ankew i Bewnen."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"It means 'Life in Death' and 'Death in Life,' respectively. You see them as two skeletal figures, one male and one female. Explorers have found them carved opposite one another in doorways, but I know of no particular legends that speak of them."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"She's one of the youngest manifestations of Berath, but a familiar one nonetheless. Stories describe her as a gaunt knight in black armor with black eyes, black hair, and milk-pale skin. She demands an impossible toll from travelers who have tarried too long on her lord's road. 

"Some challenge her only to slay themselves in the process."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Kith have written stories, songs, and poems about the Usher for centuries. Sometimes he's folk, sometimes dwarf, and sometimes merely a walking skeleton. He never speaks, but he guides the way to death. And the next life. He also creates the circumstances for the wayward to stumble into their own graves."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Of course. Berath was once more widely worshiped in this area, but it is a silent god." He smiles sadly. "These days, people find themselves in need of clearer answers."</DefaultText>
