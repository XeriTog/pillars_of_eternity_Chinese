      <DefaultText>The orlan hovers by the window, peering out of it every few seconds. As you enter the room, she watches you carefully, her hand hovering over her stiletto. She cranes her head to peer behind you.

      <DefaultText>The hand over her weapon relaxes, but she's still watching you closely. "Some... old friends from Defiance Bay are looking for me. We're not exactly friends anymore if you catch my drift. I'm just trying to lie low and mind my own business. Know what I mean?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"All right, all right." She raises a hand to the aumaua before turning back to you.

"My friend here thinks you could maybe help us out. Now, I'm sure you're a busy man. So I'll make it worth your time." She flips you a few coins. 

"Just go take a look around town. Come back and let me know if the coast is clear or if you see any... suspicious figures."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She scratches the back of her neck. "I... may have gotten myself into trouble with some powerful people in Defiance Bay. Powerful criminal people. I suppose it was bound to happen eventually. I'm a thief by trade, and it's hard to do my kind of business in the city without crossing them eventually.

      <DefaultText>"What story? The Doemenels came after me! I just happened to rob the wrong place. How was I supposed to know they'd already claimed it?"

She runs her hands under her hood and through her hair. "It was an honest mistake. I'm just trying to survive now. And if you spoke with Medreth, you know where he's waiting. Please, help me get out of here."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She nods slowly. "All right. I'm trusting you. Don't have much choice.

"See if you can send him the other way. That should buy me some more time." She follows the hooded figures toward the stairs, giving you a final uncertain glance as she passes through the door.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She heaves deep, gasping breaths, holding a hand out to steady herself. "I... gods, I'm free." She looks at the door. "For now. I've got to go while I have a head start. And I've got to shed some weight. Here." She reaches under her cloak and gives you a set of folded leathers. "If I move fast, I won't be needing this again. Take care."

She and the rest of her companions hurry down the stairs.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Nyfre folds her arms and gnaws her lower lip. Her eyes bore holes into you.
