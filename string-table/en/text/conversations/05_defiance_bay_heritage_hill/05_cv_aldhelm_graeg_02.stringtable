      <DefaultText>A man hunches over the strange mechanism, his spine a sharp ridge rising from his arched back. He's barely clothed in filthy rags, and the patches of skin you see are mottled green. A spoiled stench emanates from him.

He's so intent on his work that he doesn't notice you until your shadow falls over him.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He flinches but attempts a polite smile. Between his ragged lips and large teeth, the effect is disconcerting.

"Something you need? I should focus." He grips the adra pillar. "Must focus."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Not your help I need, it's..." Aldhelm snarls. "Harridan. Shrew." He shivers, scowling. "Squanders her research on frivolities. Then refuses to make herself useful.

"Runes. The runes are the last part of the puzzle. Icantha knows them. She gives them to you, and you can turn the machine off. Release our souls."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"The machine. I still don't fully understand its purpose, but I did figure out that this portion could be reverse-engineered." He points to some of the copper running from the pedestal to the machine. "This could also be used to route essence through the machine to the individual operating it.

"I can't make any promises about the specifics, but it would almost certainly deliver a significant degree of power to whoever tried it." He looks at you hopefully.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He hisses. "That's what I'm trying to figure out!" He smashes a fist into the adra pillar. His hand makes a crunching noise but doesn't bleed.</DefaultText>

      <ID>32</ID>
      <DefaultText>He turns to you in a sudden burst of passion. "Years I've been doing this! Years. I know how these things work. But I don't know..." He gazes at the forsaken district beneath the tower. "...How this happened."

He gestures at the streets. "Nowhere to go. That's the problem. Their souls are trapped here like flies in a jar. Clinging to rotting meat."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>38</ID>
      <DefaultText>"No time to slow down. But..." A tremor of frustration runs through his face. "I can explain. Hold a magnet over iron splinters and they stick, yes? Rub your hand over wyr wool and the hair of your head will follow it. 

"So it is with this machine."

He looks at you and runs his tongue along the edges of his fine, strong teeth. He quickly looks away.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"It has the power to manipulate souls. But why? For what? And how many others lie buried in the ruins of Eir Glanfath?"

He screws his fists into his eyes. "No. Focus on this one. It's imprisoned our souls in our bodies. Cut the root between essence and flesh. Left a dwindling soul stuck in a shriveling husk."</DefaultText>

      <ID>44</ID>
      <DefaultText>He closes his eyes and holds the sides of his head. "Fifteen years at Brackenbury. Seven tours to the ruins beyond Solace Vale." His eyes snap open. "I'm an animancer. Still an animancer." His gaze lights on the adra post with sudden recognition. He starts to turn back to the copper dials.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He snarls and grips the copper controls. "I'm so close! I can figure it out, reverse the mechanism. I just need time. Time and..." He doubles over coughing, and when he looks back at you, his teeth flash for a brief moment.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"There's no time for jokes!" He shakes his head. "There's no time. This machine. I have to figure it out while I still can."

      <DefaultText>"I didn't see him. My assistant..." He hesitates, his lips working soundlessly as if he can't remember - or can't say - his name. "He saw him. We laughed. Said he was spooked by the cemetery. Perhaps it was already too late.

"I don't know what he did. But by morning, the machine was on, and we were slain. People were already on the streets, complaining of neighbors and family members acting strangely."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Please!" Aldhelm closes his eyes. "She won't listen. You've got to help me!" He grabs the pillar for support. Opening his eyes, he seems to notice it for the first time. "Help me." He touches the copper symbols as if trying to puzzle out their meaning.</DefaultText>

      <ID>72</ID>
      <DefaultText>"No! You can't leave." He looks around. "Trindig! Where-" He sees his scabbed, withered hands, and a look of horror and anguish crosses his face. He looks back at you and howls.</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>75</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Yes, Icantha. She was here, in the district. Probably here still. Always prepared. Clever lady, that one."

A violent tremor racks his body. "And perhaps you bring me something? Something to keep me sharp. Then I show you a secret about the machine. Something to make you strong."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Not yet." Something gurgles in Aldhelm's throat, and he grimaces.

"But I will be. My body is dead. My soul, imprisoned in this corpse, only makes it seem otherwise. And as the body decays, so does the mind, until nothing is left but the hunger." He heaves and retches, eyeing you strangely.

"The only way to forestall the process is through a regular infusion of essence. Living flesh is the only ready supply." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>One shaky hand scratches at his bare, sore-eaten chest. "I'm not proud of any of it. Hunting men and women in the early days of the affliction. Picking off soldiers that came to investigate. 

"But I'd do it again. I'll do it as long as I must to end this disaster."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"She lived out here among a handful of patrons and charged them all a fortune for translations of Engwithan writings. Useless stuff, mostly - poetry, hymns, folk tales.

      <DefaultText>"Something happened on our eleventh night. Lights in the sky and a static charge in the air. But we were so careful...

"We were staying in the chambers below. Trindig, my assistant, said he saw a robed figure lurking around the tower. Wore a mask. Carried knives at his sides. A trick of shadows, I told him. The next morning, we felt strange. Like we hadn't eaten in weeks. So dazed that we didn't at first notice the blood around our beds, the strange wounds that had appeared overnight..." </DefaultText>
