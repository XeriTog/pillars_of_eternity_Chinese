      <DefaultText>"Trust me, you don't want to." The guard shrugs. "But if you were really set on seeing this for yourself, I suppose you'd have to get permission from Wyla at the keep in First Fires."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"So you're the one she sent word about." The guard looks you up and down, frowning. "I was expecting her to send in a whole squad of justiciars. Not that I'm volunteering, mind you."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I'll have the gate opened immediately. Just watch your step. I'm afraid we can't send anyone after you if this goes badly."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Friend, I try to see and hear as little as possible. One of the women on the last watch said she heard someone shouting from the northeast part of the district, something that sounded like an order. But I don't see how anyone could survive in there.

"Once or twice I've caught a glimpse of something moving on the other side of the gate." The guard shudders. "I'd just as soon forget it."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"None. And I've no desire to find out, if you catch my meaning. The ones that disappeared weren't the deserting type.

"The worst part is, both times the watch disappeared, the next rotation found the gate unlocked. I don't know whether they went in or whether something got out, but if it's the latter, refugees are going to be the least of our problems."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Glad to see she's got our best on the case." The guard glances at the gate. "This place is eerie enough without a watch or two disappearing every week."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Both guards look at each other. "Look, even if I were allowed to tell you, I don't rightly know. All I can say is it - whatever it is - started about two months ago. The guards that closed the gate talked of something unnatural that still wakes them in the middle of the night. I don't want to know any more than that."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The guards glance at each other. "Look, we could get in a lot of trouble for this... but then, it's not like you could make things WORSE in there."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"You hand us a thousand pands, and I'll open the gate and then look the other way. And don't bother trying to bargain us down - that money will make sure our families are okay if we're found out."</DefaultText>

      <ID>47</ID>
      <DefaultText>"So, you turned the tower off by accident? I suppose we should wait awhile and see if it's really safe. If so, uh... good job."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Take it easy!" He looks at the other guard. "Look, it's your neck. Don't say we didn't warn you." He turns and unlocks the gate.</DefaultText>
