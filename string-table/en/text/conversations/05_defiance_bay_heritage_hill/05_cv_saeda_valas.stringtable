      <DefaultText>She inches into the candlelight. Her clothes are little more than filthy rags now, but ripped and stained fabric looks like embroidered silk. "You have to be quiet. Noise brings the hungry people."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Mother and Father and Emilo boarded up the door. But the hungry people found our house." Her fidgeting becomes more agitated. "They fought, but the hungry people always get up again. They broke through the door, and Mother told me to hide.
