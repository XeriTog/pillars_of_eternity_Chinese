      <DefaultText>On the ground where the dragon had curled around it, you find a stone that glows a brilliant orange, yet is cool to the touch when you reach to retrieve it. 

Durance catches a glimpse of it, and his eyes bulge out of their sockets. He scowls, his mouth puckered as though having tasted poison, and he spits on the stony ground.

"A whore's cruel jest. The bitch has always known where to sink her claws to get a rise out of me."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>For the first time, Durance seems to become aware of his demeanor, and as quickly as it had flared, it seems to recede, until you start to question whether he had been angry at all.

"Hm? No, it is not anger you see. I am merely the victim of a divine practical joke, it seems. That will remain between she and I, Watcher, for only I am able to appreciate it."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"One wonders. The bomb blew big, but it would not have sent fragments this far from the citadel. The drake must've carried it quite a distance. Or Magran merely put it here herself."</DefaultText>

"If you mean in terms of copper... there was a time when it might've been. But the markets soon became flooded with pieces of the Godhammer, most of them no more than the trivial enchantments of swindlers dabbling in wizardry. Counterfeit."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"As there has never been a reliable way to judge a fragment's authenticity, and the would-be judges are often Watchers, questionable as the artifacts themselves, their value has plummeted considerably.

"Ask any shopkeep if he's interested and he'll try to sell you his fragments instead."</DefaultText>
