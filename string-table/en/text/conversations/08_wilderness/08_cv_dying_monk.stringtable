      <DefaultText>"This must be delivered to my order." The monk weakly grasps for his satchel, drawing from it a messenger's scroll case. "Take it!" he rasps, waving the missive at you.

"It needs... needs to be carried to the Celestial Sapling. Give this to my brothers... they will reward you."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The man on the ground gasps for air, clutching his chest as he struggles. On closer examination, you see his red cloak obscures the full extent of his injuries. His face whitens as blood pools around him. "Please. Traveler..."

He reaches out, arduously extending his hand to you.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Forgetful - so careless," he mutters, blood seeping from his lips. "Cuts on my knuckles from... from morning's practice." He holds his blood-soaked hand out in front of him. "The stelgaers - they smelled the blood on me, thought they found their next meal."

The man reaches down to clutch his left leg, his finger running along a jagged length of bone protruding from his knee. "They were almost correct."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>As you move close to help, the monk places his hand on yours, and gently rebuffs your efforts with his remaining strength. "Your intentions are kind, but I must embrace my suffering, and ready my soul for its next journey."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"No!" The monk holds up his hands, but the effort throws him into another coughing fit. "I wish to embrace my suffering until my final breath!"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The wax seals break easily under your fingers as you pry open the scroll case. You unroll the scroll, seeing an official watermark through the delicate parchment.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>As you lean in, you hear no breathing. See no movement. Gently you close the monk's eyes before you glance at the mysterious package at your feet. The wooden scroll case is a bit dirty, but you can clearly see five wax seals running the length of the case.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The scroll case is crafted of darkly-stained oak in the likeness of a thin tower. Along its length, five wax seals adorn the case, each with its own symbol: a small flame, an open palm, a crescent moon, a shining sun, and a balanced scale.

The seals would more than likely break if you were to try and open the case.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The man lets out a long sigh and smiles at you with a slow, knowing nod.

"You are known to us, Watcher. We know you have treated others honestly, fairly." His face becomes pale and lapses into a wide smile. "And I have need of someone trustworthy to finish my mission."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The man stares at you intently for several moments before his eyes widen in recognition.

"I've heard of you! Your cruelty is known to us. Will it please you... please you to watch a stranger die? Would it please you more to know I die with my mission unfulfilled?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Through the pain, the man cracks a slight smile. "We know of you!" he yelps with excitement, the effort leaves him wheezing.

"I know of you - of your kindness, your charity! Will you help me?" He eyes a blood-soaked satchel amongst his possession. "I am beyond saving, but my mission can still be salvaged."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The man eyes you with a glimmer of recognition. "You... you are the Watcher! I am told you are dishonest, manipulative... but you are-" the man bites his lip, shaking as a wave of spasms rock his body.

"You are all I have in my final moments... please, listen... I was on a mission to deliver-" his voice trails off but his eyes fixate on a satchel resting by his side.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>A pained smile creeps across the man's face. "I would comply, brother, but my injuries are too severe.

Blood erupts from the man's mouth, his body twitching as he drowns in his own humors. Moments later, his lifeless form is silent and still.</DefaultText>

Blood erupts from the man's mouth, streams of red, oozing down his neck. His head slumps backwards, and his body goes still.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>With a measured hand, you very slowly massage the wax seals until you feel each seal slowly give way without cracking. When you are done, each seal appears visibly intact, and only a small application of heat is needed to reseal the container and hide any evidence of tampering.

Before doing so, you read the scroll contained within...</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Rejoice, seekers. The judicious application of pain has loosened the tongue of our informant. The artifact we seek has recently been moved to Elm's Reach - it should be secured in a residence near the entrance of the settlement. The informant suggested it is likely stashed away under the floor. We have endured much in our pursuit of this hallowed relic - soon our efforts will come to fruition. The council of Archmartyrs awaits your triumphant return. Do not fail us.</DefaultText>
