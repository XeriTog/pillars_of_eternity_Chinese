      <DefaultText>A trickle of blood runs from a cut on his brow down to his neck, staining a locket worn on a gold chain. "You're not Glanfathan..." He tightens the grip on the sword's handle. "By Magran, friend or foe I said!"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Esmar's face turns flush and you see the hint of a smile come across his face. "We'll take any help we can get. We're pinned between the stelgaers to the north and the Fangs to the south. If you can scatter either group, that'll clear an escape route for us."

      <DefaultText>"Resourceful girl!" The captain huffs a chuckle before returning to his humorless frown. "We assumed the Glanfathans killed her before coming upon us. I'm relieved she's alive - doubly relieved she brought help."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Esmar blinks and arches his eyebrows in surprise. "All of them?" The creases around his eyes deepen as his smile grows. The mercenary captain turns to his company. "Hear that boys? Looks like we've got a way out. Get to it!"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Sword still pointing at you, the man gives a sideways glance to his companions and nods. The mercenaries lower their weapons. "A rare and welcome sight - friends this far from home." He lets the weight of his sword lower his arm.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He gives a concerned look to his mercenary company. "Look at us... hiding in the rocks and holding in our guts." He points south. "The Fangs... they've bloodied us and now we're trapped."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He rests his sword, still caked with blood, across his shoulders. "The tribesmen ambushed us just as we made camp. The fight was a... lopsided slaughter." Esmar stares at his feet as he finishes his thought.

"In the melee, someone tripped through the campfire. We were 'lucky' in that regard... the stench of burning flesh and the choking smoke obscured the scene and a few of us managed to withdraw."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"We ran to these ruins to regroup, but now we're trapped. The facepainters are just south of our position and they have us cornered. No doubt they're happy to let us starve while they rest and rebuild their strength before attacking anew."

His left hand idly toys with a locket worn around his neck. "Seems this is where we will be making our last stand," he mutters as he clenches the gold ornament.

      <DefaultText>"We could run that way, maybe evade the Glanfathans if we're quick, but..." The captain looks over his shoulder and shakes his head. "We've spotted a pack of stelgaers up there. Given the options, I'd rather some facepainter kill me right quick than die slowly, bite by bite, to a feral cat."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He glances northward. "If I didn't know better, I'd wager those beasts are working with the tribesmen. But I'm sure they're just here following their stomachs. Just look at us, limping on our injuries and covered in blood. We must smell like butcher's shop."

      <DefaultText>"Focusing on the positive?" he asks with a laugh as he flips the locket between his calloused fingers.

"This is for my son - for when he's old enough to be trusted with such things. Born a few months ago. Not hollow... Hylea be praised."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Told my beloved the child would want for nothing." He looks you in the eye with an embarrassed smile. "Probably should have also promised her I wouldn't throw my life away treasure hunting in Eir Glanfath. Here's hoping the boy gets his smarts from the mother's side of the family."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He turns to address his soldiers. "Gents, gather up your gear and lace up your boots - looks like we have a chance at going home!"

He hoists his backpack over his shoulder. "When a path is clear - north or south - give us word and we'll beat a hasty retreat back to the Dyrwood."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>They cheer, their voices kindled with purpose, and spring into march. Esmar raises his fist and shakes it. The locket dances as if jerked into life. The captain nods and gives you one last look before joining his companions.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Esmar blinks and arches his eyebrows in surprise. "You've... convinced them?"

Creases around his eyes deepen with his growing frown. He looks at his locket and then lifts his eyes back to you. "Prisoner? If it's the only way to save my men... I'll endure it. But whose prisoner?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The captain turns to his company, each of his soldiers stare back, pale with fear.

Esmar takes a deep breath, then raises his fist in the air. "New orders - you are to fall back. The expedition is over. Stow your gear and make for Defiance Bay at once!"

The mercenaries exchange glances with each other, waiting for the first one to obey the command.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Are you deaf? I won't tell you again. Time to go! NOW!" Esmar's booming voice springs the reluctant mercenaries into action. Wounds are dressed one last time, camping gear is secured, and within minutes, the men set off on their march, nodding at their leader in acknowledgment as they pass.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>As the last man clears out, Esmar turns to you with a nod. "I started this, I should finish this." He draws a knife from his belt and slides it under his left glove and into his wrist with a yelp.

"Go tell... go tell the Fangs I honored the bargain," he says as he settles down on a ruined rock wall and slides the blade into his other glove. He closes his eyes and slumps over into a slow-breathing heap as blood pools about him.

      <DefaultText>"Rotting in a Glanfathan cage? Half wondering if death is a better option."

      <DefaultText>"YOU will hold me prisoner and that will satisfy them?" He takes a half-stride back and looks you up and down.

"So be it, I am more than willing to be held hostage if it means we all get home safe. I'm sure you will have to keep me as a proper captive to honor the arrangement, but I understand. It's far better than being the Fang's prisoner..."</DefaultText>
