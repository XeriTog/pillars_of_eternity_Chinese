      <DefaultText>A woman in gleaming mail stands guard before the shrine, her head bowed in thought or prayer. The clasp of her cloak bears the engraving of a dog's head. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She looks up as you approach, discarding her solemn appearance for a crooked grin. "Greetings, stranger. Don't see too many travelers out this way lately. Shame, really." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Your next blow sends the dragonslayer to her knees. She looks up at you with undisguised loathing, gritting bloodied teeth. "You... you don't know what you're doing." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The amulet writhes in your pack, seeming almost to be alive. You feel a pressing compulsion to do as the dragon asked - and place it about the woman's neck. </DefaultText>

      <ID>12</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Think what she will do, with this freedom." The amulet heaves and twists, and a thick miasma seems to pour from the heavy gem, unseen by all but you. It moves towards Falanroed's eyes and face, and you hear her shout of anger as she recognizes too late the renewed incursion. </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>13</ID>
      <DefaultText>"No!" She tries to rise, only to crumple once more to the ground. "You will regret-" What else she meant to say is swallowed up by her strangled cry. Her limbs jerk, fingers spasming. </DefaultText>

      <FemaleText />

    <Entry>
      <ID>16</ID>
      <DefaultText>You have the impression of a weak, frail light rising from her body - only to be scattered by a sudden, pulsing glow. You are struck with a fleeting sensation of despair... and then, a stronger, heady triumph. </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>17</ID>
      <DefaultText>For a moment all is still, and then Falanroed's gaze settles upon you once again. Her eyes gleam a familiar, fiery gold. She looks down at herself, with cursory interest, and then rises smoothly to her feet. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"We were a ragtag bunch from the beginning. Started with clearing wurm infestations, and then we began to hunt down the drakes. Members came and went. We earned some fame for ourselves after we helped bring down a full-grown dragon." </DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>22</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Some of our members fell in with the Hounds, or else the Society of the Talon. Me, I don't much care for looting old temples or rubbing elbows with highborn pricks convinced they're Galawain's chosen." </DefaultText>

      <ID>24</ID>
      <DefaultText>She makes a strangled noise, a growling cough, and then, frowning, tries again - "Is that... to be my name as well? Better to keep it, I think." </DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>29</ID>
      <DefaultText>She turns towards you. "You have freed me. It is no small thing, to have a dragon in your debt." </DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>33</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Yes, I know him. So you are what chases him across the Dyrwood. He waits for you, in the house of madmen, in the city you call Defiance Bay." </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>34</ID>
      <DefaultText>"There is a name with many years behind it. Is that your quarry? I know not where he walks, nor can I fight him for you. You would only rob yourself of the answers you seek... and take up Maerwald's habits in his place." </DefaultText>

      <ID>40</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Two thousand years... and now I am free. I know not where I will go first. The Vailian Republics, perhaps? Or the plains of Readceras. I should like to... run, I think." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"It's a long story. Let's just say there's a dragon with its mind set on your corpse. She wanted me to find you." </DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>51</ID>
      <DefaultText>Almost as soon as the words clear your lips, the amulet you hold shatters with a loud crack. You feel a foreign, cresting wave of anger come upon you, and then the feeling is past. </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />

      <DefaultText>Falanroed studies you with sober interest. "It seems she wasn't happy about you telling me the truth." </DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>53</ID>
      <DefaultText>Falanroed jerks back almost in the same movement as you reach out - but you prove faster. The chain falls about her hand, and the heavy gem pulls it down the rest of the way.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>54</ID>
      <DefaultText>She turns the adra gem over in her hands. "This is... quite the gift. I fear I don't remember the occasion, but I am glad I could have been of some service." </DefaultText>

      <ID>57</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Having a few words with the Father of Monsters. It tends to be a one-sided conversation." She smiles a little. "I come out here on occasion. I try to keep the shrine clear of branches and the like." </DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>59</ID>
      <DefaultText>"You would think so. I suppose it depends what you're hunting. Trolls and their kin live here in abundance, living off what bandits stumble into the brush." </DefaultText>

      <ID>65</ID>
      <DefaultText>"There are many different hunts. Perhaps you're more of a scholar? The pursuit of knowledge, I have heard, is a worthwhile endeavor, even if not to my own tastes." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Dragon hunters." She smirks. "Or so we fashioned ourselves. We worked very hard to ensure our prey never reached that stage." </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>68</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Nor will you find many here. The bandits have made short work of them." She smiles thinly. "There is more fearsome game to be found in some of the more distant regions of the forest. The Black Meadow is not as it used to be." </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>69</ID>
      <DefaultText>She looks up as you approach, discarding her solemn appearance for a crooked grin. "Greetings, stranger. Have to say, you're a soft-footed one. Barely heard you coming along." </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>70</ID>
      <DefaultText>She studies you quietly a moment. "Of course, perhaps you would look to the cities for your own quarry." </DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>71</ID>
      <DefaultText>"But most of the deer have moved on, and the more impressive beasts have already been slain. You might have better luck to the southeast. The Searing Falls, or Elmshore." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>There's a flare of light from the amulet, which pulses like a star. Falanroed's face darkens, mouth pressed into a thin line as she concentrates. "Idiot. You think to buy an alliance with a monster? I'll not be the coin you do so with!" </DefaultText>
