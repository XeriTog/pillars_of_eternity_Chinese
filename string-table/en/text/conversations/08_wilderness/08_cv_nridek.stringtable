      <DefaultText>A robed, gangling creature lurches toward you, and you feel something needling at your brain again. The screeching hiss that invades your mind is edged with rage.

"Digging and ferreting animal!" It pauses, its mouthpieces clacking. When its words fill your mind again, they're tempered with fear. "My legacy."</DefaultText>

It draws the stone closer to its narrow chest. "Long-dead animals put spirit-stuff in metal." It points behind it. "I keep spirit-stuff in stone. Take to new colony. Colony alone is weak. Young frail. Empty of wisdom. But two colonies together survive. Make strong colony."</DefaultText>
