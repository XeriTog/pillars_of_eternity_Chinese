      <DefaultText>The elf holds a chipped wooden pipe. The sweet smoke wafting from the bowl makes you dizzy.

"Welcome, estramor. I've got herbs and potions for sale. Looking for something to ease your travels? Or something to make them more interesting?" When she grins, you see her teeth and gums are stained brown.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She takes a deep draw on her pipe. "Poisons? I only deal in tonics that heal and enlighten." 

She exhales a puff of smoke. "Of course, many beneficial substances can be harmful when taken in great quantities, but that's just Weretha's way of keeping all things in balance."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She frowns, her teeth clamped around the pipe. "Poor thing. Here, take this." She gives you a vial filled with a dark fluid. "It works slowly, but this will send him back to the cycle kindly enough. Just see that it doesn't get misplaced - half that dose would kill an aumaua."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Hiravias sniffs at the air, his smile growing wider with each twitch of his nose.

"Whiteleaf!" he says with a smile. "I once ate a porcupine whole while smashed on Whiteleaf. I miss those days..."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She leans against the winding tree trunk and ticks the items off on her fingers. "Oh, there's plenty. Concentrated carow golan, undistilled spider venom, rotten blood moss extract, cave coral mixed with Skaenbone..."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Her eyes brighten. "An herbalist yourself, are you? Here, take this." She gives you a vial filled with a dark fluid. "This should keep you busy for a while. Only use a little at a time, and see that it doesn't get misplaced - half that dose would kill an aumaua. Slowly, perhaps, but surely."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She gives you a quizzical frown and takes another drag on her pipe. As the smoke filters through her teeth, she starts to giggle. 

"You're funny. Here, just because I like you..." She gives you a vial filled with a dark fluid. "Whatever you mean to do with it, see that it doesn't get misplaced - half that dose would kill an aumaua. Slowly, perhaps, but surely."</DefaultText>
