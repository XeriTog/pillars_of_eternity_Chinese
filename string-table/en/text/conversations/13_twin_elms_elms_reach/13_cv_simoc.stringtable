      <DefaultText>A grizzled old elf, his hair braided and dyed, stands at one end of the hall. His arms and chest are crosshatched with the pale seams of scars. 

His crooked smile looks like another.

      <DefaultText>He reaches out with a hand gnarled by age and battle. He clutches the vial close to one faded blue eye.

"To my tribe's salvation."

He drains the vial in one long gulp. When he looks back at you, his eyes are bright with purpose. "And to your good fortune, traveler. May this be of use to you."</DefaultText>

"To my tribe's salvation."

He drains the vial in one long gulp. He swallows, and after sputtering for several seconds, he glares at you. His breaths sound ragged and wet. "You... you poisoned me." He begins to raise his hand to the warriors in the other room.</DefaultText>

He looks to the main room of the hut, where others have gathered. "I am in Twin Elms to confer with some of the other anamfatha about the onolf&#234;n - your Hollowborn. We only have such births here on occasion, but it has made us more vigilant about our neighbors."

"But we share a tradition of fostering the children of other tribes, and the anamfath of Fisher Crane has trusted his youngest to my care."
