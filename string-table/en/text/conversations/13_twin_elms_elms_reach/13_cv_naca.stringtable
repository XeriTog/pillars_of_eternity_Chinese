      <DefaultText>The petitioner before you is swaddled in loose-fitting robes. Her hair is greasy and matted; a glossy film of sweat and grime coats her exposed skin. She has the swollen features of pregnancy and several missing teeth in her big, grinning smile.

As you approach she slowly turns to you and examines you from head to toe, smiling the entire time.

"Joyous day to you," she says. Despite coming from a wearied body, her voice sounds resonant and relaxed. "I am Naca, midwife and lore keeper."

      <DefaultText>As her eyes scan over Hiravias, she clasps her hands in front of her mouth in excitement. "And a joyous day to you as well, Many-Colored-Hunter. Are you here for supplication or for strength?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"No, it's fine," he says without taking his eye off the woman. "I just thought for a second she was calling me short, that's all."

He scratches at his ear stump and sniffs at the woman. "So what did you mean that Galawain gave me a 'gift?' Hasn't felt like one to me."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"The text that line these walls..." her thought comes to an abrupt halt as she runs her hands along her shoulders with a contended sigh.

After a long moment, she becomes aware again of your conversation. "They are meditations on nature and loss, strength and sacrifice. They will make sense to your friend."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Flawless!" she replies. "Apologies, I should be left to my meditation. The rite of strength is invigorating - almost overwhelming to the senses."

She reaches down and cradles her belly in her hands and turns away.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"All he's given me is ostracism!" Hiravias yells. His voice echoes through the cavernous expanse and his face becomes flush.

"I could have been useful to my tribe if my spiritform were a simple fox or crane. Powerful or not, my tribe reviles the Autumn Stelgaer - to them, I am a soul-devouring monster! Don't speak to me like it's some sort of gift!"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Galawain would not bless you with a second self that you do not truly need. If the Autumn Stelgaer feels like an affliction, perhaps you have it backwards. Galawain gives you the tools you need to hunt - he has no cause to burden his hunters unnecessarily."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I still don't..." Hiravias shrugs and scratches his head, shaking loose several mites and gnats. "Is there something I need to do to cure myself of this spiritform?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Cure?" Naca looks at Hiravias, puzzled, and mutters a few half-words.

"My dear child, the Autumn Stelgaer IS the cure. Galawain blessed you with that form so that you may live in reunion!"

She spreads her arms in a sweeping motion, "Walk about the Blood Sands and read the texts we have preserved in stone. They will tell you what you need to know."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Naca smiles, "I know it is a fearsome creature sent by Galawain to deliver judgment. Those found unworthy and slain by the beast have their souls lost forever."

Hiravias' eyes widen as she talks, but before he can interrupt, she adds: "I am simply telling you what the loremasters before me have said."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You smell Hiravias a moment before you feel his hand on your side. "I don't think she's going to be of any further help - let's read those scriptures like she said."</DefaultText>
