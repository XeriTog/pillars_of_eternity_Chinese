      <DefaultText>Wrdha's head turns to you, but she seems to look past you through clouded eyes. "I have heard the screams of the others and smelled their blood in the air. A grim irony that the Ethik N&#244;l should perish alongside a millennium of sacrifices."

The ancient dwarf inhales deeply. "Your doing. Come to finish an old blind woman, too? Or have you other business?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Like any worthwhile ritual, it's too complex to explain in detail. It involves clotting the supplicant's essence, binding it to their life's blood, and drawing it into a container or vessel."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"This the raw, bloody heart of Eir Glanfath. Where some come to give their essence back to their people." Her dry lips bend into a sardonic grin. "Where others seek a noble escape from their trials.

"The legacy of the Builders to the tribes was not merely adra and stone, but a sense of community. And it is here that Glanfathans come to sacrifice what is most precious - even their own lives - to preserve it."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The elderly dwarf blinks at you, not quite looking at you. Her eyes are pale and clouded with cataracts.

"Welcome to Blood Sands. It is rare that an estramor sets foot in these caverns." Her sightless eyes fix on you as she tilts her head. "What brings you here, I wonder?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She takes the orlan baby from you, shushing her gently. "A precious little thing." She strokes the child's downy head. "Her soul shall return, fit to lead thousands."

The child begins to burble and coo as Wrdha bears her away, disappearing down the hall.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Wrdha returns, a fresh trickle of blood visible on one wrist. She hands you a potion. "Return that to Simoc and instruct him to ingest it before his next attempt at copulation. This formula will strengthen him and his issue."

Her lined face is grave. "May this sacrifice be an asset to all the tribes."</DefaultText>
