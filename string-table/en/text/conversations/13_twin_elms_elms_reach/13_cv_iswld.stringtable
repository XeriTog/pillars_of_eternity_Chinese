      <DefaultText>"I do, although it is for the safety of overconfident aspirants as much as for the peace of the ancestors. The Weald has a way of denying those deemed unworthy.

"However, Bethwl has sent word that you require a special audience."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I congratulate you, estramor - you have completed a journey that few are capable of.

"Bethwl will be eager to hear of what you've learned. If her suspicions are correct, the words of the ancestors hold great portent not only for you, but also for the future of Eir Glanfath."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I have prepared the snowcap according to ritual. But be warned." She holds up a finger. "Though some portion of the journey will take place in your mind, the dangers you face in the Weald can still claim your life.

"The journey will begin whenever you choose, but it will not end until you have spoken with the ancestors or perished in the attempt."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"May your journey be instructive." She removes an oiled leather pouch from her robes. As she opens it, a heavy, musky odor assails you. The grove begins to spin, finally fading into darkness.

When at last you come to your senses, you stand in an unfamiliar forest. The ground beneath your feet feels solid, and you do not think you are imagining the wet chill in the air.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"We are the ovates - druids, philosophers, and students of nature. We gather here to share our knowledge and celebration." 

She gestures to another elven woman standing near the entrance to the grove. "Many travelers come to us for poultices and remedies. Bledha understands the cures and poisons of nature like no other."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"High Ovate Erona leads us. She sometimes journeys to Elmshore to renew her strength, however - she's there now with some of her closest followers, in fact.

"Erona is a mighty elm among us - she's lived for generations. There are none who understand the world as well as she, and we are fortunate to have her wisdom to answer our questions."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She lowers her head. "That's unclear. Erona's passing has shown us the perils of leadership, even when authority is as benevolent as hers." 

She looks on at the kith gathered in the grove. "Most of us became ovates so that we wouldn't be shackled to the whims of a god. Some of us have questioned what it means to elevate another as we did Erona."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"We believe that knowledge is found in the earnest exploration of the natural world."

She tilts her head. "We do not, as some have said, oppose the gods. We simply believe that we have found a brighter, more peaceful path than devotion."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Her eyes brighten. "Why, you must meet her for yourself! She is wise and kind, and she has led our order from the beginning. Yet she walks among us and gives freely of herself."

She turns her gaze to the great, twisting elms. "That is what so many of us cherish about her. She is present among us in a way that the gods never are."</DefaultText>
