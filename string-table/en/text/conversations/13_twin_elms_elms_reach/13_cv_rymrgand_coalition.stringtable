      <DefaultText>You kneel and close your eyes. As you pray, the blackness fades to white, and a howling wind fills your ears. The vision that slowly resolves itself is of a broad, frozen plain.

You see a procession of elves in the distance, periodically fading into and emerging from the whiteness. They trudge over snow banks, their heads down against the driving winds. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>When you kneel at Rymrgand's shrine, you again see the wall with its glassy doorway of ice. There is a hole in it that fits exactly the shape of the ice shard you received.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"A crack in the ice. A fissure in a glacier. I showed you the Frost-Hewn Breach that you might seal it. But you pried it wider for the sake of the Glamfellen, whose souls I had not yet begun to hew away." The aurochs utters a booming grunt.

"For all things there is a season. You brought them to winter before their time."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You kneel and close your eyes. As you pray, the blackness before your eyelids fades to white, and a howling wind fills your ears. The vision that slowly resolves itself is of a broad, frozen plain in the midst of a snowstorm. Something moves at the center of the blizzard, plodding but relentless.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>As they trek past you, one man bundled in furs turns his head. "You headed for Noonfrost and the Frost-Hewn Breach, too?" Before you can answer, he's lumbered ahead. You follow the caravan, and in a couple minutes, you come to a wall of ice. 

It disappears into the pale emptiness overhead and stretches as far as you can see in either direction. The elves stop in front of a mirror-smooth section that's framed like a temple door. It seems somehow thinner than the rest of the wall. You can't see what's on the other side, but a debilitating cold emanates from within.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The elves pull pickaxes and shovels from their sealskin packs and begin hacking at the smooth ice, their implements flying through the air in swift, shining arcs.

Though they throw their bodies into their labor, not one of them so much as scratches the polished ice. Yet with each blow, something bellows in the distance.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You grab the nearest elf by her shoulder, shaking her and yelling over the howling winds. You point in the direction of the booming noise, but she only scowls. 

"Leave us, traveler. We've got to get through. We can't stay on this side any longer."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You strike the nearest elf, and he crumbles into a mound of snow. You attack another, and she falls just as easily. While you cut down the elves around you, their fellows continue cleaving at the ice, working faster. Even their redoubled efforts seem futile.

When the last of the elves falls, the bellowing finally ceases and the wind dies down. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>A final gale blows past, scattering the remains of the elves in a chaotic flurry.

You notice a single spiderweb crack in the smooth barrier. It's the only thing that mars the perfect surface of the ice. 

Whatever's on the other side of the strange doorway, you feel it tugging at you. Only when you look back and see the parallel gashes trailing behind your legs in the snow do you realize how strong its pull is.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You watch as the elves continue to work at the ice. They pay no heed to the rumbling roar or the numbing wind.

Their movements, however, gradually slow. They labor at the ice with arduously sluggish movements until they finally freeze in place, some mid-swing and others preparing for the next blow.

You touch the elf nearest to you, and he crumbles into a mound of snow.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The elf strains to listen. As she rests her pick in the mounting snow, some of her fellows pause in their labors.

A man with a withered, frostbitten finger turns. He raises his maimed hand, and the others stop, as well. 

They stand motionless for several seconds before you realize they've frozen entirely. You touch the elf nearest to you, and he crumbles into a mound of snow.</DefaultText>
