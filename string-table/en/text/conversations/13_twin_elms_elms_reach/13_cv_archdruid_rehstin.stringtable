      <DefaultText>The dwarf wears crimson robes that are stained and streaked with dark patches. His face is smooth but lacking youthful elasticity. It's as if the lines and wrinkles have been formed and erased many times over.

He watches you with eyes like two black pits as he wipes his hatchet on his robes.

      <DefaultText>The smooth skin at the corners of his mouth and eyes wrinkles for one brief instant. "It was a sacrifice, and one willingly entered into. The survival of all things depends on balance. Give and take."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"We believe that all life has power and that this power can be siphoned and conducted. We are not, as some suggest, madmen and murderers. All of our rituals are conducted with willing participants and through methods that have been tested and refined over centuries."

He nods, his black eyes shining. "This allows us to create the war paint for which we are respected, if not loved."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>A dwarven man stands on a raised platform. Beneath him, an elf lies prone on a stone table. As you get closer, you hear the dwarf speak in a gravelly monotone.

"...As your blood flows, so shall your essence. Your life's energy shall feed the soil, and your soul's energy shall enrich the community. This is by your own choosing, supplicant?"</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />

    <Entry>
      <ID>34</ID>
      <DefaultText>The dwarf grips a hatchet with both hands and raises it over his head. He throws his shoulders forward and swings the weapon into the elf's chest, connecting with a meaty thump.

Blood gushes around the blade, and the sacrifice's screams rend the air. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Yes." The elf's voice is high but even.</DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>40</ID>
      <DefaultText>Despite his earlier agreement, the elf thrashes atop the stone table, his torso arching while his arms and legs remain tied in place. Meanwhile, the dwarf spreads his arms wide and allows blood to spatter his robes.

When the elf is finally silent and still, the dwarf pulls his hatchet from the body and wipes it on his hem.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"This principle lies at the heart of all power. Expending something of value releases energy. Energy that can be channeled by those who know how."

He tilts his head toward you. "All kith, whether or not they care to admit it, practice this. We take the yield of the land and the flesh of beasts to live. And we give our blood and sweat to propagate the things we desire."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>42</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I invite you to explore our halls and speak with our supplicants. One can learn much by observing the sacrifices others are willing to make for a greater purpose. Perhaps you will even consider making a sacrifice of your own." 

He opens one hand toward you. The creases and nails are darkened and brown. "Not all of our sacrifices are written in blood, but the most powerful are."</DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>43</ID>
      <DefaultText>A guttural laugh rumbles from his throat. "We merely believe that, in giving up something of value, the energy from that sacrifice can be diverted elsewhere. It is not so different from what folk practice all over the world. If you want to turn the soil, sail a ship, or move a cart, you must expend energy."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"A special unguent binding raw essence to the wearer. It grants incredible advantages in combat and has made us indispensable to the tribes. Whatever they say about our practices, almost all of them have made use of our war paint at some time or another."

A slow smile spreads across his face. "Fascinating indeed how the most strident objections can be overcome by circumstance."</DefaultText>
