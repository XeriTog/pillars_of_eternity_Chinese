      <DefaultText>Though his eyes are closed and his posture still, the man before you keeps his head aimed at you, as if carefully following your movements.

      <DefaultText>The man's eyes remain closed and he says with a smile: "Tranquility begets a receptive mind."

He opens his eyes, revealing brown irises clouded with the beginnings of cataracts.

"With my eyes open, I see your birth form. But when I look inward," and with this, he closes his eyes again, "I see the Autumn Stelgaer."</DefaultText>

"What do you know about the beast? Why was I ostracized just for being able to assume its form? Is there a cure?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Tamrwn smiles, his eyes remain closed. "I know the beast is often sent by Galawain as a sort of trial. Many anamfatha are tested by the Autumn Stelgaer - those bested and consumed by the beast have their soul torn from their bodies and lost for all time."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"So... my tribesmen were right?" Hiravias looks crestfallen, his posture slumps, his gaze drops to the ground. "Are you saying I have such a terrible power? This must be some sort of-"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"If your spiritform were a bee, would you be mystically compelled to make honey? Were it a bird, would you spend all day making nests?"

Tamrwn opens his eyes once more and looks Hiravias up and down before wincing, and shutting his eyes once more.

"I am saying this is what the animal your form resembles is known to do. It seems you are eager to leap to your own conclusions."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I would not normally advise one to speak with the circle at Blood Sands but... given your circumstances, the Ethik NÃ´l may prove of insightful."

He turns and, with he eyes still closed, points to the northwest. "Read the stone slabs carved by the druids of the Blood Sands. There are answers to be found, as well as more questions - but you must explore them for yourself."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Much of it is utter rubbish on the incessant 'need' for... sacrifice," his calm countenance wavers as he says that last word with spit and a hiss.

"But... amongst the dogma are a few bits of wisdom on Galawain. Your friend will understand."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I appreciate the attempt to lift my spirits," Hiravias grumbles, "but that doesn't really help."

Hiravias sighs and digs into his ear stump with his index finger. "But he has a point... I shall trust Wael has something to show me in the Blood Sands."</DefaultText>
