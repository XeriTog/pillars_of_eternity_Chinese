      <DefaultText>As you kneel in front of the shrine, you feel yourself pushed forward. You catch yourself on your hands and knees, feeling warm, damp ground beneath them. Looking around, you find yourself crouched in a clearing in the middle of the woods. The smell of dirt hangs heavy in the air. 

Behind you is a darkened room filled with candlelit shrines. Ahead you hear the howl of some kind of hound.

You feel certain this is a vision, but the hairs on the nape of your neck still rise.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You kneel, prepared for the shift this time. The cool stone gives way to warm soil, soft and loamy. The candle smoke dissipates, replaced by the musk of the forest.

The hound howls from the foliage.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The beast bays in response, its voice high and clear. The thick undergrowth shivers with movement, and heavy paws pound the wet grass. You're not certain if the creature is hunting or leading you, but you instinctively give chase. </DefaultText>

Something leaps from the bushes. You find yourself pinned on your back and staring into the amber eyes of a massive hound.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>As you tumble through dew-spackled bushes and clawing brambles, each stride feels longer than the last. You draw lungfuls of crisp, clear air and feel your energy renewed. The rhythm of your stride and the thumping of the beast's paws drive the blood thrumming into your ears. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You speed ahead, following the hound's cries, when a splitfinger pine crashes to the ground in front of you. A massive bear lunges into the gap and roars. 

It catches sight of you. You turn and race in the opposite direction, leaping over the fallen tree trunk. Pine cones crunch underfoot. The bear lumbers after you. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Its hot breath washes over the back of your neck, filling your nose with the rank odor of slaughter. You see a clearing just past a thicket of broadleaves and sprint toward it. 

As you break through the foliage, you see a massive lioness curled up in the clearing in front of you. With a last burst of energy, you divert your momentum and hurl yourself into the bushes. </DefaultText>

      <ID>23</ID>
      <DefaultText>Any second now, you expect to feel the bear fall upon you. But a furious roar on the other side of the clearing draws your attention. 

The bear has stopped at the treeline. It swipes the empty air with claws large enough to rend armor, but it does not advance. The lioness, for her part, twists her body into a tight coil. She growls, her ears pressed against her head, but she makes no move to attack the intruder.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You back deeper into the foliage, keeping your eyes on the two mighty predators. As you crawl backwards, the heel of your hand brushes something furred. A warm sigh grazes your cheek. You freeze in place, slowly turning your head to see what waits behind you. Two amber eyes shine in the darkness.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>When you turn back, the lion and the bear have disappeared. In their place is a stone wolf's maw, gaping wide enough to swallow you whole. Beyond it is the outline of a temple, towering but indistinct.

"Blood must feed the Maw, Watcher. See that a true champion reigns."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You follow the hound's tangled path through the undergrowth. Branches whip at your cheeks and the wind whistles by your ears. As you pass a fallen pine, the route begins to feel familiar. 

You reach the clearing where the bear and lioness face off, snarling but keeping their distance. The hound watches from the bushes, its amber eyes shining. You can see nothing else of the great beast but its long, blood-red tongue as it licks its muzzle. Beyond it is the stone wolf's maw, set amidst temples and ruins.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The beast looks at you. Gleaming fangs protrude from the sides of its mouth. Its nose twitches as it inhales your scent, starting at your shoulder and proceeding down the length of your arm. You follow its nose to your hand, which is covered in blood. 

A tongue as red and meaty as a steak lolls out of its mouth and swipes your bloody hand. Its lips curl into what looks like a smile.</DefaultText>

      <ID>28</ID>
      <DefaultText>The beast looks back at you, and as it fixes you with its glowing eyes, its muzzle retreats into a long, bearded face, and its pointed ears lengthen, dropping to the sides of its head. 

What was a massive hound becomes a giant of a man, his broad, muscled shoulders draped with furs. He holds a flint knife to your neck and grins, revealing a row of long, pointed teeth.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He lets out a howl that rings through the air. He lowers his head, puffs of steam rising from his panting mouth.
