      <DefaultText>Calisca breathes in her surroundings. "Been a long time since I've been this way. But I always did like it.

      <DefaultText>Calisca sighs unevenly. Her eyes search the ground at her feet.

"My sister moved out here, sometime back. She sent me a letter. She seemed... worried. But that's how she always is.

"This time, though, she asked me to come out. And that's got ME a little worried."</DefaultText>
