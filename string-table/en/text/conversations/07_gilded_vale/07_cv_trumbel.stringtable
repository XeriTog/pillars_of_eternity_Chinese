      <DefaultText>Trumbel nods a curt greeting. "You're back. Have you had any luck with Sweynur?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>An elven man stands before you, his relatively stocky build suggesting a life of labor. His face is pale and drawn, and his eyes wide. Behind him, a younger man and woman exchange worried glances.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The miller raises a club as you enter. It shakes violently in his grip. "Get back, if you value your life!"</DefaultText>

      <ID>10</ID>
      <DefaultText>The miller hesitates, then lowers the club a fraction. "Who are you? Is Sweynur roping foreigners into his little crusade now?" </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Trumbel looks to his son and daughter, and they shift nervously in place. "Speak with me? What for? I've already told him I can't give him what he wants. Now he ropes some stranger into harassing me on his behalf?" </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>21</ID>
      <DefaultText>Trumbel shakes his head. "You picked a bad time to come visiting. Gilded Vale's had all its shine scraped off. Just a big dung heap, now, and Sweynur thinks he's king of it. They're all of them mad." </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>22</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Really?" Trumbel sighs relief. "Hylea's tits, could I use a friendly face. I take it you heard some part of what that crowd's asking for. Grain, as if I've got it all tucked away somewhere." </DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>31</ID>
      <DefaultText>"The dwarf. The one standing out there spreading lies among the villagers. Bastard's been here for decades, and he hasn't gotten any kinder with time." </DefaultText>

      <ID>37</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Sweynur's been egging that lot on for days now. They've been keeping clear so far, but if things keep on like they are... I don't know how much longer we've got before things get messy." </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>38</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Please... If you're not here on his behalf, maybe you could speak to Sweynur. He won't listen to me anymore. Just explain that we're all getting smaller rations, now. We're all making sacrifices." </DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>43</ID>
      <DefaultText>"With all the poison Sweynur's dripping in their ears, it's not going to be long before someone decides they'd rather do things the messy way. And I won't let anything happen to my family." </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>

      <DefaultText>"Fine. Then I'll be on my way." </DefaultText>

      <ID>47</ID>
      <DefaultText>Trumbel blinks, taken aback. "I'm not - Look, it's no lie. The stores really are low. And with so little grain going around... I had to raise the prices for some people."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>48</ID>
      <DefaultText>"...There are folks in this town that deserve far better than Sweynur and his lot. People who have done more for Gilded Vale." </DefaultText>

      <ID>50</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Sweynur's people are farmers. They gathered that grain for you." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"What do you mean?" </DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>52</ID>
      <DefaultText>"They sure didn't mind losing that grain when it was going into the drinks at the inn. They don't make like kind neighbors when they insult my son, go stumbling drunk through my own crops. You think they're the only ones that need to eat?" </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>58</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Now the crops are sick, and the wind's too weak to get the windmill turning. Our village's children are born as... empty shells. That's not my doing. This place is cursed. And Sweynur and the others haven't done a thing to help the rest of us through the lean season." </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>59</ID>
      <DefaultText>"...I can't do anything about that," Trumbel says, his voice quiet. "That's just how it works. Maybe things are different elsewhere. Here, Raedric's men, they keep the village safe. So they eat well." </DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>60</ID>
      <DefaultText>"The magistrate's not waiting outside to burn down your home. Maybe you ought to give the farmers fairer prices." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Is your self-righteousness worth losing your family over?" </DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>66</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Sweynur, the rest... they've always been troublemakers. Loud, drunken fools. That woman with him, her soul traces back to Dryhdon, that wretched brigand - and it shows." 

"We have good people in this town. People still hanging onto what's left of it. They deserve a little more. That's all I'm saying." </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>67</ID>

      <ID>70</ID>
      <DefaultText>The miller all but sags with relief. "I'd be grateful if you did. He won't listen to me anymore, but maybe you'll have better luck. Tell him we're all having a hard time of it, and we'll all have to make some sacrifices." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Trumbel opens his mouth to protest. But his expression shifts into resignation well before he finally nods and speaks. "You're right," he says, quietly. "I've been trying to plan for the future... but we're in danger here and now." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"All I do with the grain is sell it. I can't create it out of thin air, and I can't hand it out for free. I pay the farmers for the crops they bring in, and I sell what comes out of the mill. Most of it goes to the Black Hound, on the west side of town, for ale. And Sweynur and his lot sure don't mind that part."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>82</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I can't pay top prices for blighted wheat, and I've barely got enough good grain to go around. Sweynur's howling after things he has no right to." </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>83</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Maybe I ought to go have a talk with Sweynur, then." </DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>86</ID>
      <DefaultText>Trumbel frowns. "It's not..." He pauses. "Look, Sweynur's always been a rotten bastard. With stores so limited... maybe I save the good stuff for people who deserve it. Aufra, for instance. She's expecting a child. Should I let her starve instead?" </DefaultText>

      <FemaleText />

    <Entry>
      <ID>97</ID>
      <DefaultText>The miller blinks owlishly. "Dead? But..." He shakes his head. "No, I... I won't ask. I suppose I shouldn't take this as good news, but when a man threatens your family..."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>98</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Why, that's... really? That's great news! I wasn't sure you'd get through to him. They're out of their minds with drink, half the time." </DefaultText>

    <Entry>

      <ID>105</ID>
      <DefaultText>"You take a look at the fields on the way into town? The crop's blighted. And most of what I'm getting from the farmers?" Trumbel gestures to the sacks and containers. "It's gone off, rotted through."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>106</ID>
      <DefaultText>Trumbel shakes his head. "Where to begin? Sweynur's whipped them up into a froth, going on about the grain stores. Claims I've hidden away most of it."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>109</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Fine. Tell Sweynur and the others that I've reconsidered. Provided he pays the same as everyone else, he's welcome to his fair share." Trumbel sighs. "And let's hope we can trade for supplies real soon, or we'll all be in a bad way." </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />

      <DefaultText>Trumbel sighs. He nods. "I understand. You're not a local, and these aren't your problems." He wipes his brow. "Perhaps I can speak to the magistrate..." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"In any case, I thank you. For letting me know, that is. And... here, as a token of appreciation." He weighs out some coins in his hand, and presses them into your palm. "Perhaps now we'll stand a chance of getting this town back on its feet." </DefaultText>

      <ID>122</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I owe you a great debt. Here." He pulls a coinpurse from his hip, and pushes it towards you. "Today's earnings, to show my appreciation. And you can be sure I'll let everyone know what you've done for me." </DefaultText>
