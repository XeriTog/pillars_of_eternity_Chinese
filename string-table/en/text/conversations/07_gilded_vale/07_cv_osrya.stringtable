      <DefaultText>A woman, caught mid-step across the room, turns her head to face you. Long curls of black hair frame her face, one side of which is flecked with some green liquid. The gaze she sets upon you holds an eerie intensity. </DefaultText>

      <ID>15</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Oh, I think not. I can't have you threatening Lord Raedric's life. How would I continue my research, if he were gone?" She frowns. "Still, perhaps we need not be enemies." </DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>25</ID>
      <DefaultText>"You must be another of Kolsc's little rebels" Osrya chuckles. "Does he recruit you all out of the Black Hound? Ply you with drink? Ask you to ignore the consequences of your actions?"</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>26</ID>
      <DefaultText>"No matter. What concerns me is the curse upon Gilded Vale's people. I am on the cusp of a great discovery, and it is not Kolsc who undermines me." She eyes you. "You might have chosen more powerful allies." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Osrya regards you coldly for a long moment. At last, she throws her arms up in the air in frustration. "Of course he did. I thought I'd have a few days, at least, before he resumed his growling." </DefaultText>

      <ID>28</ID>
      <DefaultText>"If Lord Raedric wishes to see swifter progress, then perhaps he might deign to provide the materials I need. Does he think he is the only one growing impatient? I am 'gifted' with this..." She gestures to the room. "...pitiful little 'laboratory', and he expects miracles."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>29</ID>
      <DefaultText>"And meanwhile that old wretch, that useless priest, has the whole of the upper keep to himself. What does he provide? Superstition and useless advice!" She lets out an angry gust of air. "Very well, then. Look upon my progress. I have made what use of Kolsc's filthy cohorts I was able."</DefaultText>

      <ID>30</ID>
      <DefaultText>"You..." Osrya's face darkens with anger. "That pompous old fool. He dares send some errand boy down here into my laboratory? To save his little protege?" </DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>40</ID>
      <DefaultText>"It isn't the superstitions of senile old men, I can tell you that." Osrya snorts. "The Legacy is an affliction of the soul, and I have dedicated my life, alongside my peers, to understanding the fabric of souls. The essence of life."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I consider myself the foremost student of Pandgram's famed Theorems. It wasn't by chance that I was called here to assist in determining the true cause of this blight." </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>42</ID>
      <DefaultText>"This 'curse' is not a parting gift from the Scattered God. Nor a punishment for petty sins. It must be a localized effect. Something which strips the soul from a body, as the bîaŵacs are known to do."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>43</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I have detected, even so, lingering traces of essence upon the bodies of so-called Hollowborn. This suggests that the soul itself has not been wholly destroyed. It remains, I think, intact somewhere. And so it can be retrieved - sutured, if you will, back into its mortal flesh." </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>44</ID>
      <DefaultText>Osrya's expression goes cold. "It's that fool priest, Nedmar. The Berathian." She sneers. "That old man has woven a tidy little tapestry of lies and fables. Lord Raedric is a pious man, and Nedmar holds power over him - especially now, after this business with Ygrid... as if that Hollowborn child was my doing... In any case, my efforts are increasingly hobbled by ignorance."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>45</ID>
      <DefaultText>"The priest has focused Lord Raedric's attentions upon the ruins of the Scattered God's temple. If it is consecrated anew, rededicated to Berath, then the curse will be lifted." Osrya rolls her eyes. </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>46</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Raedric believes him, of course. In any case he has supplied a vast amount of gold towards the effort. You will note that I am bereft of such generous support." She gestures to her lab with a sweep of her arm. "I am left to scrounge for answers in these dismal conditions." </DefaultText>

      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>49</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I want you to deal with the High Priest, of course. With him gone, Raedric will have nobody to distract him. We can focus our efforts upon resolving this crisis - and we will have the resources to do so."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>50</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Kill him - and in return I will give you the means to speak with Raedric. A secret way, by which you can avoid the guards." Osrya smiles crookedly. "They are not as patient as I, you see. Nor do they ask many questions before attacking." She raises a finger. "All this, with the condition that you do not harm Lord Raedric." </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>51</ID>

    <Entry>
      <ID>53</ID>
      <DefaultText>"There are stairs up to the kitchens in the northwest corner of the dungeons. Follow those up further and you will reach the Berathian priests' quarters. You will find Nedmar there, within his chambers. The old man hardly ever leaves, these days." </DefaultText>

      <ID>56</ID>
      <DefaultText>Osrya's smile fades swiftly. "Very well. If it's battle you long for, I'm happy to indulge you. Perhaps Lord Raedric will show me greater favor if I bring him your corpse as well."</DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>57</ID>
      <DefaultText>"But now it is time that I hold up my end of the bargain. In the time leading up to Lady Ygrid's... untimely death, Raedric had my predecessor doting upon her at all hours. There is a secret passage into those chambers. One that I have the means to open - if you will assure me that you will not bring harm to Lord Raedric." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Remember, the fate of Gilded Vale rests upon my research. There are few in these parts that are kindly disposed towards animancy, and Lord Raedric's demise would, to put it mildly, be a considerable set-back." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Osrya moves towards a nearby table, and bends to touch something. You hear a rattling click, and then a low rumbling, as a nearby wall begins to slide into a recession in the floor. Osrya smiles thinly, gesturing to the newly revealed hall with a flourish.</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>65</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Hm. Well, we shall see. It may be that Raedric throws you in the dungeons, in the end." She smiles. "And then, I'm afraid, our interactions will be far less pleasant."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>68</ID>
      <DefaultText>"And you mean to do it here?" Osrya glances about the laboratory, smirking. "Very well. I suppose I can't expect you to defeat a frail old man at anything less than your full strength."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>72</ID>
      <DefaultText>Osrya watches you approach, a rather typical expression of mild interest on her face. "So - you've come wandering back after all. I take it you received Lord Raedric's little missives?" She sighs. "He's retained his flair for the dramatic. I suppose that's of scientific note. The lasting power of character flaws." </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>73</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I, of course, have been permitted to remain. Alive, at that. I was rather surprised." Osrya glances around the throne room, sighing once more. "Things aren't quite the same, of course. Lord Raedric has survived his own death, but his scientific curiosity has not. I am left to create feeble creatures so that he might inflict them upon his enemies. That would be you, if that's unclear. Truly inspiring work, you can imagine." </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>

      <DefaultText>Osrya considers you a moment. "Hm. I do believe I've gleaned what information I can from this place. Perhaps it's time to return home and continue my research under more pleasant circumstances." She nods, and aims a slender finger towards the door to the northwest. "You'll find him at the topmost point of the keep. The siege platform. As I said - flair for the dramatic."</DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>77</ID>
      <DefaultText>Osrya snorts. "I have survived far too much to fall here at your hands. But if you mean to die before you ever have opportunity to face Lord Raedric, who am I to deny you?" </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Kolsc was not, as you might imagine, terribly appreciative of my work. I suppose I'm to be eternally grateful that my life was spared?" She rolls her eyes. "Go meddle in someone else's affairs. I have no further use for you." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Seek him out there, and he'll oblige your challenge, I'm sure." She pauses. "Best of luck. I can't say I like the prospect of a dead thayn upon the throne." She inclines her head, and starts down the steps.</DefaultText>
