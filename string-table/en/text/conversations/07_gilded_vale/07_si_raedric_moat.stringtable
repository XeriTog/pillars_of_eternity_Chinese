      <DefaultText>Set into the base of the keep's outer wall, a sewer grate spills murky, foul-smelling wastewater into the keep's surrounding moat. Slick, mossy stones form a precarious bridge across the murky water. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Ahead, the iron bars of the sewer grate block passage. The bars are coated with rust, and several appear bent, or sit at strange angles. They may have been weakened enough that you could bend them, given the means. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>With a groan, one of the iron bars begins to give. You heave, and at last the bar snaps free of its base with a crunch. Beyond the broken grate, a dark passage leads further into the keep. Murky water flows through it in a continuous stream.</DefaultText>

The metal bends steadily under the strain until, with a snap, it breaks free of its moorings.
