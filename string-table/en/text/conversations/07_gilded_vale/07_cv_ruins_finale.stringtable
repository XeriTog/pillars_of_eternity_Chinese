      <DefaultText>Four figures stand before an otherworldly apparatus, an ancient structure of chiseled adra and metallic veins, ominous and looming like a silent observer.

Standing motionless in their midst is what appears to be a human body, colorless as stone - or ash. The other figures gaze upon it in what might be contemplation. From your vantage point you are well obscured from their view.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The figure closest to the machine stands out among them. A thick gray beard frames a face otherwise hidden beneath a metallic mask.

His faded robes are embroidered with a runic language unlike anything you have ever seen, and he wears a strange black headdress with two protrusions that jut out like the wings of some malevolent creature.

      <DefaultText>He addresses the petrified body. "...Oathbinder bear witness and see this man has kept his word, true to his last breath, full to his blood's last drop. Guide his soul, Queen That Was, and regard it among your Favored. Let his life by the Key be his confession. Let his death by the Key be his absolution. May he walk the world ever free of the crushing weight of the Book."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The man passes his gaze over the others standing around him. "Your brother has done his part, and you have seen the power of his contribution. I will accept no further hesitation from the rest of you." He looks each in the eye in turn.

"In the sight of the Queen That Was, will you fulfill the oath? Will you take your place beside your brother in the endless esteem of Her memory that is without flaw? Step forth and be assured of the great worth of your life's course."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The man walks to the apparatus. He extends his hands toward its eroded stone with the certainty of a great musician reaching out to a favorite instrument. He seems to say something, but his words are lost on the wind. Then the man strides out and is gone.

      <DefaultText>Suddenly, the great mechanism flares up with a pulsating thrum that reverberates through your body and rattles your teeth when you don't hold them clenched. It washes over you all at once, then seems to pull at you like receding ocean waves.

The remaining figures fixate on the device, as though waiting for it to acknowledge their presence.</DefaultText>
