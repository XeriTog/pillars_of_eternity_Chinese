      <DefaultText>Straining against a gale that threatens to pull you off of your feet with every step, you set your hands in the worn folds of weathered rock and set about pulling yourself up the precipice.

With a last burst of energy before your arms give out, you swing yourself up onto the ledge.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Heodan trails behind, slowed by injury and delayed by early hesitation.

As he nears the face of the rocks, one of the fallen attackers, who had been feigning death, lunges for Heodan and topples him onto the rocky ground.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Restrained, Heodan lashes out against his fatigued assailant, but struggles to break his hold.

They are close to you. Despite the wind, from your position, if you were to throw your weapon at the attacker, you would have a good chance at hitting your mark.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Your aim is true, and the hit jars Heodan loose.

Lurching to his feet, Heodan clambers up the base of the rocks. As he nears the top, however, the wind flares, pulling him sideways and tearing one of his hands free...</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Wresting free of the attacker's grip, Heodan lands a blow that sends the assailant reeling, and he makes a mad dash for the ledge upon which you stand.

Suddenly, as he reaches for the rockface, his body jerks back and is rigid, as though it were a bow being strung. His shrieks of pain grow panicked, abandoned of all restraint, like someone tethered to a stake and set aflame. 

A slender wisp of spectral light emerges from his back, rising out of him like smoke before separating itself and disappearing into the ether.

All at once, the screams stop, and Heodan is dead.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>...but diving out onto the hard rock, you manage to catch hold of it. Securing his other hand, you pull with waning strength, and it feels as though your arms will be jerked from their sockets. They hold just long enough for Heodan to set his feet and join you on the trembling ledge.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>There is a deep resonance to the wind now. You feel it in the rocks beneath your feet and inside the cavity of your own chest, as though it would shake the marrow from your bones.

Each new gust menaces the old stones before you, loosening connections, unsettling balances. As you dart beneath the old archway, the entire portal begins to fall beneath its own weight...</DefaultText>
