      <DefaultText>"Curse my luck," the woman mutters, kicking her foot into the ground and upturning a clod of soil. As you approach, her ears twitch and she turns to greet you.

"Hail traveler," she says with a half-hearted hand wave. "The bridge to Defiance Bay is out. If that's where you're headed, you'll need to find another route."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"The river has been rising on account of all the storms. Here, where the river narrows, the flooding did the most damage."

The orlan woman folds her arms, a scowl overtaking her face. "Guess they don't make things to last around here, do they? One of the stone columns collapsed in a flash flood, taking the whole middle section of the bridge out to sea."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Madhmr Bridge was the most direct route from Gilded Vale to Defiance Bay. Merchants and travelers now have to find boat passage or add days of extra travel to loop around the Bay."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"So I started a ferry service, thinking I'd earn some coin and help others cross over to the Bay."

Peregund shakes her head, her ears twitching as she speaks, "And that was a bigger mistake than that time I allowed a cipher to court me."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Peregund smiles wide, her ears perking up. "Thank you! I'm sure those thugs have made a mess of my stock, but maybe there's something there to be saved."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I had been attempting to turn a quick copper but..." She bites her lip, her face turning flush with anger. "Just my luck - the blasted currents threw my ferry into the rocks... dashed it, and my profits, to pieces."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"You would make a good merchant!" Peregund blurts out with a laugh. "I'd worry if you DIDN'T inquire about your own profit motive!"

She scratches her ear, blushing as she speaks. "I am a bit destitute at the moment, but I have a shop over in Defiance Bay. If you help me recover my merchandise, I'll sell you whatever you want for a bargain."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Peregund bounces on her feet at your approach. "My helpful stranger returns! Have you managed to find anything yet? Even if all you found is driftwood, just knowing those looters got what they deserved would moisten my breeches."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Peregund's ears twitch with excitement as you drop the supplies down in front of her. "Thank you! I was beginning to think it had all sunken to the bottom of the river!"

She reaches into her tunic pocket and hands something to you. "Considers this a small token of my gratitude. I will reward you properly when you visit me at my shop in Defiance Bay."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Peregund kicks her foot into the dirt several times. "I figured just as much. Well thank you for you assistance. I suppose I need to figure out how I'll recover my investment."

At last her foot stops kicking and she lets out a long sigh. "Thanks for trying. If you find yourself in Defiance Bay, search out my shop - I'll need all the customers I can get."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"With the bridge destroyed, the best course of action would be following the river north. You'll be able to cross farther upstream - but you've got a long walk ahead of you."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Making matters worse, when I went to prowl the shore to salvage whatever shipping crates didn't sink, a pair of looters attacked me!" She stomps her foot into the ground. "The damned brigands had the nerve to attack! I managed to avoid harm but... but now they have stolen by force all that is left of my fortune."

She eyes you for a long second, her hand cupping her chin. "You know... you look like you'd fare better against those looters than little old me... Could I enlist your help?"</DefaultText>
