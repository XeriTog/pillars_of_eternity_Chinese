      <DefaultText>The squat, distended body of an elderly dwarf woman dangles from a thin, crooked bough that sags at the tug of her noose. The bloated purple flesh of her neck, worn away in patches like moth-eaten linen, bulges over the rope that suspends her, and her lifeless head lolls forward rigidly from one side to the other when the breeze shifts.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You take a deep breath, clearing your mind, focusing on your objective. As you exhale, you feel yourself spreading out toward the hanging woman, perceiving all that lies between you and her with new, unfamiliar awareness. 

Once you have expanded enough to reach her, there is a sudden jolt to your mind, a ringing, electric surge of images and words and sounds. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Involuntarily, you shut your eyes, and feel yourself being pulled down to some deeper consciousness in a space occupied only by you and the hanging woman, and when you open them again, she is staring at you with eyes clouded in a milky fog, her body still swaying in a wind you no longer feel from a tree that stands planted in a misty void.

The woman gives a slow nod of her head, the rope creaking as she does so, and she smiles at you.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You perceive a faint glow around her that casts no light on its surroundings, but there is a tepid warmth to it, and you feel somehow that you could reach out and touch it - not with your hands, but with some aspect of yourself that has no worldly dimension.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Have you come here for me, dear? Or have you gotten lost?"

Her eyes squint as she peers down at you. "Ah. It is both, I think. Yes?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She considers for a moment, looking down at her own limp body. "No, I think not." 

Her tongue clicks, and she shakes her head. "A pity, that. It would be simpler. A mercy, even. To not have to wonder anymore, no?

"Alas, we are here, you and I. Wherever 'here' may be." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Caldara moves her tongue around in her mouth as if testing it. "Is that what we're doing? Perhaps it just seems that way. Perhaps it is the easiest way for your mind to make sense of it."

She gives you a motherly smile. "I think it is a very good choice."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She nods, a look of pity on her face, as though consoling a child.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"You have seen past the Shroud. It only takes an instant. Your soul remembers, yes? Remembers how it sees when it leaves the body, like being reminded of a dream you had forgotten." She nods again.

"You are a Watcher, now. And a Watcher you will stay."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"What's a Watcher?"</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>16</ID>
      <DefaultText>"What indeed. Long hours have many animancers spent studying such things. Not I, though. Not I.

"I'll tell you what I know, though, since fair is fair, and here we are visiting, you and I, and it reminds me of better times."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Souls pass on. Some say through adra stones which are the blood-veins of the world. They leave the world for a time and are reborn into it, sometimes more than they were before, but usually less, and seldom the same.

"For all souls, there is a time when they do not live, yet have not passed on, and those souls roam the world same as you or I, either leaving or Lost. But no one sees them because they have forgotten how."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"A Watcher sees, though. Knows what to look for. 

"And sometimes they know a person just by looking at them. Know where they've been in ages past when their bodies were other bodies. See memories even their owner can't recall. A wonder to behold when all goes well. A wonder."</DefaultText>

      <ID>20</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Oh. Nothing to be afraid of, I'm sure. It's just... much to take in for some. Sometimes there's trouble sleeping or other difficulties."

She smiles at you reassuringly, fanning out a tuft of long whiskers that sprouts from one of her cheeks.

      <DefaultText>An inspired gleam crosses her murky eyes. "YOU should see old Maerwald. HE could tell you much more than I. A Watcher, just like you. Helped many in his day. Took up in an old keep no one would claim, not far, not far. Caed Nua, beyond the Black Meadow. He will welcome the company."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Caldara appraises you with scholarly interest for a moment before resuming her cheerful demeanor. "Did you now, dear? My, that would be something, wouldn't it?

"Could be luck. Could certainly be. A storm can be a careless thing."</DefaultText>

      <ID>25</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Or maybe it got its hands around your soul, but couldn't pick it up. A soul can be heavy if it's stayed in one piece through its time. Strong souls, we call them in the trade."

She smiles sadly at a thought. "Called, I mean. Called them. Those days are all behind me, no?"</DefaultText>

      <ID>27</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Oh yes. Entropy. Rymrgand's work. We know little of why or how. We lose pieces of ourselves when we die and pick up pieces of others when we're born again, but less than what we lost. We've tried to stop it with the animantic sciences, but with little success, oh no."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>28</ID>
      <DefaultText>"A very small few resist Rymrgand's influence and stay together through some force of defiance, at least for a time. But they all succumb eventually, I think." She clicks her tongue.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Goodbye, my dear. It was lovely visiting." Caldara closes her eyes and her head slumps forward over the noose, and your surroundings seem to bleed into your vision from some unknown place of waiting.</DefaultText>

      <ID>31</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Me?" She shakes her head in protest. "I'll bore you to tears, though."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>36</ID>
      <DefaultText>She breathes a mild sigh, sending a small beetle skittering from inside her cheek. "And here I thought you'd come to visit me in particular."

Her arms turn outward stiffly in what might be a curtsy. "Caldara de Berranzi, of the Vailian Royal Academy of Animantic Sciences. Not the greatest of their number, but I came here all the same because this was where help was needed."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"What's an animancer?"</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>38</ID>
      <DefaultText>She laughs - a rasping, choked cackle escaping between rows of buttery yellow teeth, causing her body to bob up and down with each spasm.

Seeing your blank expression, she catches herself.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Well, I came where I was needed, didn't I? Offered my services to Lord Raedric for a pittance. A humble pittance.

"I was to examine the lord's wife, see why the gods have seen fit to poison her womb. Studied her for months. Looked high and low for impurities, tested her valence, the permeability of her essence. Do you know what I found?"</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>41</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Tell me."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>42</ID>
      <DefaultText>She shakes her head. "Nothing at all. A healthy woman, head to toe, blessed with a beautiful soul. Such a sweet woman, too. Meek, but warm-hearted.

"A few months' time and the lord of the house demanded answers. For a time I told him what he wanted to hear. 'Oh yes, my lord, she is riddled with imbalances. I must have time to cure her.' As the birth drew near, he grew impatient, as lords do. And this is where I've ended up."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"A student of the soul. Something so basic, yet so poorly understood. But so many breakthroughs have been made in my lifetime."

She chuckles. "Had been made. Had been.

"To hear the locals tell it, we're a gang of soul-manglers that preys upon the weak minded. And the worst of us are."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"It's a fascinating science. A fascinating time to be alive in a place like Dyrwood that does not control the research, no? I loved the Vailian Republics for many things, but their recent caution will leave them behind, I fear."</DefaultText>

      <ID>45</ID>
      <DefaultText>"But the best of us? The best? Inspirations. Miracle workers. My parents were soul twins. Miserable before they met. Empty inside. It was an animancer who helped one find the other. Turned their lives around.

"You wouldn't believe the stories. Amnesiacs helped to remember their lives. The suicidal brought back from the brink of oblivion. The elderly afforded extra moments to say their goodbyes. How soon we forget when we're afraid."</DefaultText>
