      <DefaultText>This man appears to be hurriedly dismantling his camp in quick, jerky movements. He looks up as you approach, his expression tense and drawn. "Greetings," he says, a little breathless. "On your way south, is it?" </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He wipes his brow, turning to face you. "The sooner you're clear of these woods, the better, I think."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The man's brows furrow in concern. "Ruins... the old Engwithan place? You'll want to keep clear of those, whatever you saw. Strange things always crop up around Engwithan sites. I don't doubt those people you saw were up to no good."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>His expression falls. "I... We came across a bear, in a cave to the north. Got the better of a friend of mine. I only just made it out with my life." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"We didn't see it coming." Nonton's voice shakes a little as he speaks. "We were following a stag. Perly, he saw something in the brambles, and we went tearing off after it. We all but stumbled into the cave. Poor Perly didn't stand a chance... the bear was on top of him before we knew what was happening."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"The Beasts will take what they will, I suppose, " He smiles sadly. "And this time, Galawain's favor fell upon the bear." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Nonton gives you a curt nod. "I'm just getting my things together and I'll be out of here soon enough. Anything else you wanted?" </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Never mind the woods - there is a strange machine in the ruins up north. There were these figures, clad in black... performing some kind of rite."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"In any case, this forest's already cost me a friend. I'm heading home before it takes anything else." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"You're headed the right way. Shouldn't be too much further, and there's no missing it if you keep to the road." </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>22</ID>
      <DefaultText>"But you'll want to keep clear of this place after that. I... we were just attacked, north of here. Me and a friend of mine. We came out here to hunt some deer." </DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>23</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Hard luck, and I'm sorry to hear it. You should be fine from here. There's no missing the Vale if you keep to the road, and you haven't far to walk." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Name's Nonton. Born and raised in Gilded Vale. Haven't had a spot of luck since." His face twists. "Luckier than Perly, I suppose." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"We were attacked just north of here. Me and a friend of mine. We came out here to hunt, figured we'd bring home a stag, eat something other than bread for once." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The man looks down at the tent, and then at his hands. "I mean to follow my own advice. Came out here on a hunt. Me and a friend of mine. Thought we'd bring a stag home, eat something other than bread for once." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Came up on a bear, instead. Great, monstrous thing. And Perly... he didn't make it." He shakes his head. "I don't know what I'll tell his wife." </DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>35</ID>
      <DefaultText>"In a cave, a ways up that way." He turns to point to the northwest. "I wouldn't seek it out, if I were you. It was a great brute of a beast. Would hate to hear that it took another life." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Let the Glanfathans deal with it. They don't take kindly to trespassers, whatever their intentions. And there's enough to worry about in these woods as it is."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Don't get too many of your sort coming out this way. Meaning no offense. Suppose you're headed for Defiance Bay." </DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>39</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Have to say, don't see too many aumaua out this way. You headed to Defiance Bay? Lots of work on the harbor, I hear." </DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>40</ID>
      <DefaultText>"You look to be a long way from home. Meaning no offense. Not sure what brought you down here, but it's no place to go wandering alone." </DefaultText>

      <ID>41</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Don't see too many of your sort along this road. Meaning no offense. Suppose you're heading into town?" </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I slew that beast. It won't trouble anyone again." </DefaultText>

      <ID>43</ID>
      <DefaultText>"You killed it? You mean, you went into the cave?" Nonton's face goes still. "And you... saw nothing else?" </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He lowers his gaze. "No, never mind. It would only make a grisly sight. ...My thanks, stranger. You've done what I could not, and avenged Perly." </DefaultText>
