      <DefaultText>A man lies resting against the wall, lit by the dim illumination of the fading sconces. He has a gaunt, foxlike aspect, and his face is pale and damp with sweat. One arm is held loosely against his side, sleeve soaked with blood. He gives you an anxious glance as you near, his features twisted with pain.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"This temple isn't what it used to be. Probably for the best. Times being as they are." He groans and shifts position, wincing. "I'm no looter, if that's what you're thinking. Not one of the faithful, either. Just wanted to do some good, I suppose. Got my arm clawed up for it." He regards you wearily. "Maybe you'd have better luck." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The man sags back against the wall, and raises a hand apologetically. "Fair enough. I just thought - since you're down here anyhow, and I could use the help. I'd be willing to make it worth your while, if you change your mind." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The man points a finger upwards. "These ruins around us? Used to be a Temple of Eothas. The Scattered God. A grand temple, at that. His worshipers would come from all over the Dyrwood. From Readceras, even." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Lord Raedric would clear out the place from time to time. Make arrests. It wasn't until the Legacy that he started, ah, losing patience." </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>29</ID>
      <DefaultText>"He sent his guards in to put the priests to the sword. Bring the place down, burn some of the books. And that was that." He looks away.</DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>31</ID>
      <DefaultText>"After that, Raedric ordered the temple sealed. It's been years, like that, up until recently. Lord Raedric hopes that if we rededicate the temple to a living god, then we'll be forgiven. And the Legacy will end, see?" He smiles wryly. </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>32</ID>
      <DefaultText>"But until then, the temple is as you see it. Unguarded. That's where you come in." Wirtan licks his lips. "Those priests... Maybe they didn't have a lick of sense between them, but they still didn't deserve to go like that. Chopped down in their god's house. It doesn't sit right with me." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"If you can get down there, find their remains, maybe we can finally give them a proper burial." Wirtan breathes out. "No small task. There's coin in it for you, if you need motivating." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Blazes, man, keep it to yourself." Wirtan leans his head back against the wall, looking up at the ceiling. "You'll have us both swinging, talking like that. Believe as you like - all it means is you ought to be especially interested in what I have to say." </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText>"Blazes, woman, keep it to yourself." Wirtan leans his head back against the wall, looking up at the ceiling. "You'll have us both swinging, talking like that. Believe as you like - all it means is you ought to be especially interested in what I have to say." </FemaleText>

      <DefaultText>"As you like. Once the Legacy started, Lord Raedric decided he'd been too lenient on the Eothasians. He had his people go in and put them all to the sword. Left them down there, buried, under a heap of rock." </DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>36</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Heretics or not... their deaths didn't stop the Legacy. Didn't do much of anything at all. They didn't deserve to go like that. Chopped down in their god's house." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"St. Waidwen's Legacy. The man that... housed the Scattered God a time. Lord Raedric fought in that one. When they brought the god down, we had us a celebration, here in town. We thought things would never be better." </DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>43</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I wouldn't go telling him about it. Lingering in these places, it's no good for anyone. But you do this quick and quiet, and we can do right by those priests without raising a fuss." </DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>44</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Well, I tried. Only got a short ways in before I got in over my head." Wirtan grimaces. "I haven't raised a blade in a long time. Turns out it isn't something you can just pick up again. But you look like you can handle yourself." </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>45</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Then by the flame, I owe you a good turn. But listen - the temple's been sealed off for so long, it's crawling with creatures. But if you get past them... the priests would have been down on the lower floor. They'll be there still, if they're anywhere." </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>46</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Those priests had all kinds of secret chambers. Switches in the walls, trick sconces, that kind of thing. Keep an eye out. And... take care, down there. I wouldn't want to have to send someone else after your remains."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Wirtan looks around. "Probably. Nobody's been through the place since it was sealed up. Well, apart from me, and I didn't touch anything. Any valuables in there, you get first crack at them. I only ask that you do this favor for me while you're at it." </DefaultText>

      <FemaleText>"Well, I tried. Only got a short ways in before I got in over my head." Wirtan looks up at you. "I haven't raised a blade in a long time. But a strong woman like you? You can handle yourself." </FemaleText>

      <ID>54</ID>
      <DefaultText>Wirtan laughs, and winces as it jostles his arm. "Just giving you the full story, is all. What I want is in deeper inside the temple. Where the priests lived. Lord Raedric had them killed - same as the poor bastards on that tree outside." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"The temple's been sealed up for years since - until just a short time ago. That's where I got involved. And you, now, I hope." Wirtan pauses to breathe a moment.

      <ID>60</ID>
      <DefaultText>"The thinking is it's Waidwen having a last laugh. Strikes me as a little petty, even for a dead god." He smiles thinly. "But Lord Raedric believes it. That's all that matters." </DefaultText>

"Either case, you don't see too many children around here born right. They come out and they don't cry and they don't look at their mothers. Got no soul in 'em to give 'em a personality. They just... breathe."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Wirtan looks up at the stairs. "You might talk to that Edér fellow, if Raedric hasn't hanged him yet. Word is he's a follower of the dead god. Maybe he'll know something more about this place. He's usually out by the smithy." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Wirtan smiles nervously as you approach. "Think I've sorted out the worst of it. Arm's hurting a little less." He hesitates. "You were down there a while... Did you find anything?" His eyes dart constantly about the ruins. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Wirtan offers you a weak grin. "Name's Wirtan. I've lived in Gilded Vale long enough to remember how grand it used to be." He shrugs, and looks away. "I used to help the temple, sometimes. Bring supplies. That's all." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Wirtan laughs bleakly. "Well, I meant to be in and out, nice and quick. I'm not hurting anyone, it's just... Lord Raedric's forbidden anyone having anything to do with the Scattered God. It'd be a little... harder to explain to him than you." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"That's kind of you. But there's no need. It wasn't doing me any good. You're welcome to it, though, if you find it. And more, if you help me get something more important. With the arm like this... I could use your help." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"St. Waidwen's Legacy. The man that... housed the Scattered God a time. Lord Raedric fought in that one. When they brought the god down, we had us a celebration, here in town. We thought things would never be better." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"B-back when this was an Eothasian temple, Lord Raedric, he... had the priests here killed. Thought they were doing something to cause the Legacy. He had the temple sealed up so nobody else could follow in their steps, but... It's meant that they've been buried down there, all this time." </DefaultText>

"Either case, you don't see too many children around here born right. They come out and they don't cry and they don't look at their mothers. Got no soul in 'em to give 'em a personality. They just... breathe."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Wirtan watches you for a few anxious moments. "Then... then that's that, right?" He takes a shaky breath, and picks up the grisly bundle of remains. "I'll bury them, like I said. I... I'll do that much."</DefaultText>
