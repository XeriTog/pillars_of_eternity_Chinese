      <DefaultText>This man and woman appear to have been deep in conversation, working at closing two bulging satchels. They move to embrace, until the woman notices your approach and pauses, her smile faltering a little. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Are you accusing him of something?" Ingroed looks to Nonton, touching his arm. "If this is about the accident... We're both grieving Perly's loss. But it was a wild animal's doing." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Nonton shakes his head minutely. You see a tremble in his hands. "What would make you suggest such a thing?"</DefaultText>

      <ID>7</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I had a vision in the cave. I saw Perly's last moments, as he lived them. I saw you cut him with the knife." </DefaultText>

      <ID>8</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I tried to leave the first time I suffered his temper. But he wouldn't have it." She looks away, expression pained. "Nonton... he... We met, and I knew I'd found someone special. Someone kind. Who cared for me." </DefaultText>

      <ID>9</ID>
      <DefaultText>"That's... that's not possible." Nonton stares at you. "How could you possibly know?" His hand falls to his sword belt. "I left no sign." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>A young woman stands nervously before the fireplace, face lined with worry. She looks up as you enter, startled. </DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>12</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I have grim news. I found Perly's body in a bear cave. Nonton hamstrung him, so that he could not flee the beast. I killed Nonton for his crime."</DefaultText>

      <ID>13</ID>
      <DefaultText>Ingroed pales. She throws a hand out to the side, as if to keep her balance, and then sinks to the ground. She lets out a ragged breath, not quite a sob. "You... you've ruined everything." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Please... all we want is to leave this place. To start somewhere else. We..." She looks down at the satchels. "We've some coin, saved up. You could have it. If you'll only let us go." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I don't know what you think you'd tell the magistrate. A story about a dream you had?" Nonton sneers. "But you won't take this from us. Not when we're so close. And not for that wretched Perly." Nonton draws his blade. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Ingroed sags with relief. "Thank you. From the bottom of my heart, thank you." She fumbles through one of their bags, and withdraws a heavy coinpurse, which she hands to you. "For your compassion." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Yes, I imagine so." Ingroed laughs. "We're packing for a trip, actually. I've been meaning to visit Defiance Bay, and..." She looks at Nonton. "Well, in truth, I think I've had my fill of this town." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Ingroed gazes anxiously at you. "You've returned! Have you heard anything? Seen some sign of Nonton?" </DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>39</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Oh. I see... I'm sorry. It's only that I'm worried sick. Nonton... He and Perly set off on a hunt in the Valewood, and they should have returned by now. You really didn't see them?"</DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>40</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Nonton always has his red cloak... I keep telling him that's why he never catches anything." She smiles sadly, anxiety in her features. </DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>41</ID>
      <DefaultText>"My husband. And a friend of his. They set off on a hunt in the Valewood, and they really should have returned by now. You really didn't see them?" </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Ingroed looks crestfallen. "I see. If you should happen to travel into the Valewood, please keep an eye out for them?" She wipes her eyes. "Until then, please, forgive me... I don't feel quite well." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The grief upon her face shifts into a quiet fury. Her voice trembles. "You've taken everything from me. And now you come to gloat? I'll have justice for what you've done." She draws a knife from her hip, and lunges for you.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>48</ID>
      <DefaultText>"So you were involved in this?" </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>49</ID>
      <DefaultText>She looks up at you with reddened eyes, her face twisted with anger. "You know nothing. Perly deserved far worse. But I would have suffered his abuse an eternity before wishing harm on Nonton." </DefaultText>

      <ID>51</ID>
      <DefaultText>She looks up at you with reddened eyes, expression twisting with grief. "Justice? For that... cruel, bitter man? And what about justice for us? For those that bore his temper, and his contempt?" </DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>52</ID>
      <DefaultText>"My husband was not a good man. It was Nonton I loved. Nonton who promised me I would not have to suffer Perly's touch any longer. And now you have taken him from me, and I shall not see him again." </DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>53</ID>
      <DefaultText>Ingroed covers her face, briefly, overcome. But at the last she looks up at you, eyes red with grief, and shakes her head. "You don't know what you've done." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Nonton coughs. "Y-yes, I think we met in the Valewood. I... warned him about the bear." He inclines his head. "Glad to see you've made it. Was there something else you wanted?" </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText>Nonton coughs. "Y-yes, I think we met in the Valewood. I... warned her about the bear." He inclines his head. "Glad to see you've made it. Was there something else you wanted?" </FemaleText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>59</ID>
      <DefaultText>Ingroed smiles wryly. "Only that you'll want to be moving on as soon as you can. You'll have seen the tree, I imagine. But the rot goes deeper. If you were looking for work, I'd say you have a better chance of it elsewhere." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The color drains from Nonton's face. "I... don't know what you mean. I told you the truth of it." </DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>64</ID>
      <DefaultText>Nonton flinches, but meets your gaze. After a moment, he sets his jaw and nods. "Fine. I confess it. I did it. I saw to it he'd never leave that cave." His hand falls to his sword belt. "And I'd do it again." </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />

    <Entry>
      <ID>65</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Nonton, wait-" Ingroed raises a hand. "I don't know what you saw in that cave, but this isn't what you think. Perly... my husband... he was as much a beast as that bear."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Ingroed blinks, surprised. "Then... thank you. Truly. I... I'm glad you understand. Only, here - take this, at least. I hope it brings you luck." She looks to Nonton, smiling. "We have a long journey ahead of us." </DefaultText>

      <ID>73</ID>
      <DefaultText>Nonton hesitates. And then his expression darkens. "My 'friend'. He was a cruel enough man to his friends. You didn't know him. You wouldn't defend him if you did." His hand falls to his sword belt. </DefaultText>
