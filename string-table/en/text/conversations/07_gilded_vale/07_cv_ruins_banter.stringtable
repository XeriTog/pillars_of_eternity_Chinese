      <DefaultText>Heodan leans heavily against the nearest wall, his wheezes thick and rattling. "I'm all right. I'm all right. Let's not stand by the door that just caved in."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Calisca shakes her head. "Windstorm. Of a kind they only get in Eir Glanfath. Not too many people live through them, so it's hard to know what's true.

"The Glanfathan word is 'bîaŵac.' To them it's the gods' way of reaping the souls of the land that couldn't find their own way out. But they'll take a living soul as soon as a dead one. 

"Still got yours?"</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />

    <Entry>
      <ID>15</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Glanfathans. Those'd be the 'hut-dwellers' Odema warned you about. Looked to be Fangs of Galawain, who're the twitchiest of the lot. They go ruin to ruin, looking for fights with colonists.

"Poor Odema. I think he half-expected this, once we lost the main road."</DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>18</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I don't believe that. Odema would never allow it. But as much as the Fangs are hotheads, Glanfathans don't attack without being provoked. Either they saw something and got the wrong idea, or..."

She glances down the passage beyond. "...or there's looters in here with us. That's not something we need right now."</DefaultText>

      <ID>19</ID>
      <DefaultText>Calisca's lips press together and her chin rumples. Her voice is faint. "The Wheel's got hold of them now." 

She looks up. "Gods grant them better luck in their next lives."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>21</ID>
      <DefaultText>Calisca looks you in the eye, a volatile current running beneath her voice. "Maybe you just don't know me enough to know what upset looks like. 

"And maybe I've seen worse, too. Seen worse and kept on walking, 'cause there's nothing else to be done, and 'cause there's other people you care about who still need you."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Heodan takes a step forward and his knee buckles, and before anyone can catch him he stumbles to the ground, his cheek striking the timeworn cobbles.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>On unsteady legs, he claws his way up the wall and back to his feet, but his stance is shaky, like a sailor walking on land after a time at sea. </DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>25</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I hate to say this, but we can't afford to stay put. Those Glanfathans were riled about something. Could be we got company in here. Looters will be armed and ready to kill, and there's probably a lot of them. We can't be caught sleeping in their beds."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>27</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Maybe you didn't HEAR ME. We are going to DIE in here if we don't get moving and get this place figured out before the looters come back. We've either gotta find the exit, or a damn good place to hide."</DefaultText>

      <ID>30</ID>
      <DefaultText>Calisca's face puckers in disgust. "This'll be the end of us. No offense but there's people out there I'd much rather die for."</DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>33</ID>
      <DefaultText>"We have to be careful in here. Place has been open to the wilds for a couple thousand years. Might be a lot of vermin taking shelter here. Four-legged if we're lucky, two if not."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"A bîaŵac. Spirit wind. One of the first things I learned about when I arrived here. Locals say it sweeps away the lingering souls of the departed." He shakes his head and looks back toward the exit. 

"It always sounded more like a story treasure hunters told to scare off the competition."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>36</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Those would be Glanfathans. Been here since before the first Aedyre colonists. They see themselves as caretakers of old places like this.

"To be honest, I thought Odema's warnings were exaggerated. Seems even he wasn't careful enough."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>37</ID>
      <DefaultText>Heodan shakes his head. "Everyone stayed by the wagons. Odema wouldn't have set up camp if we were too close. Unless..." He scratches his head.

"Unless they had us confused with someone else. I heard these places attract looters - brigands, thieves, and other lawless sorts. But they wouldn't have anything against us, would they? We're just passing through." He sounds like he's trying to convince himself.</DefaultText>

      <ID>38</ID>
      <DefaultText>His gaze drifts back the way you came. "I've heard a few stories of these bîaŵacs. I've never heard of anyone surviving one."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>39</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I still can't believe what happened. I'd heard stories of vengeful Glanfathans and violent bîaŵacs, but I thought most of them were just that - stories."

He sighs. "There'll be time to absorb all of this later. I hope."</DefaultText>
