      <DefaultText>"Please, sit where you like. Would you like a drink? Or a room? We have two available at the moment. I'm afraid we can't offer much by way of a good meal today." She sighs. "Unless you're fond of cold porridge." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"It isn't by choice, I assure you! We used to serve some of the finest meals in the Dyrwood. We've had a damnable run of luck, is all. It's been a bad season for the crops, and we're running low on supplies." </DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>7</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Really?" Her face brightens. "I'd be grateful to you if you did. He was traveling through the Valewood. It's probably nothing - a broken wheel, maybe. But I do worry." </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>8</ID>
      <DefaultText>[Lie] "I think I may have run across him. I'm afraid he fell victim to some bandits in the Valewood."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The innkeeper gasps, covering her mouth with a hand. "Oh, poor Tenfrith! I knew I should have sent someone else. But he insisted. 'I must have the best ingredients!' he said." She sniffs. "He was always so particular." </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />

      <DefaultText>"Hello again. Anything I can do for you? We still have rooms open, and it's never too early for a drink." </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>12</ID>
      <DefaultText>The innkeeper wipes her eyes discreetly, sniffing. "Oh, i-it's you. Hello, again. Would you like something?" </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>13</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Hello, and welcome to the-" The innkeeper looks up. "Oh! It's you! Tenfrith told us what you did for him. It's such a relief to have him back! I can't thank you enough."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>14</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Consider yourself a favorite of the house. Discounts on drinks, rooms... Tenfrith said he wanted to whip up something nice for you. He's already back to work in the kitchen." She laughs. "So, what would you like?" </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />

      <DefaultText>The innkeeper smiles brightly at you. "Hello again. Come to rest your feet a while?" </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />

    <Entry>
      <ID>19</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I'd like to buy a round for the fine fellows over there." </DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>20</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Fine fellows? You're having me on. Any more fighting and I'll have to ban Sweynur from the inn entirely." The innkeeper frowns. "Until then, it's six copper pieces for the lot." </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>21</ID>
      <DefaultText>"That'll be six copper pieces." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>[Give 6cp.] "Here you are." </DefaultText>

      <ID>23</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Please, if I can just get them talking, I might be able to convince them to stop harassing the miller."</DefaultText>

      <ID>25</ID>
      <DefaultText>The innkeeper studies you warily a moment, then sighs. "Well, that's all right, then. Here. Three drinks for the three fools. You get them off Trumbel's back and maybe he'll be a little less stingy with his supplies."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>26</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Right, then. Here - three drinks for three fools. Just take care with them. They're a hot-tempered bunch." </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>27</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Is he a dwarf? Dark hair, beard? He didn't survive the trip." </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>28</ID>
      <DefaultText>"That's him!" The innkeeper gasps, covering her mouth with a hand. "Oh, poor Tenfrith! I knew I should have sent someone else. But he always insisted. 'I must have the best ingredients!', he'd say." She sniffs. "He was always so particular." </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>29</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Of course. We keep them nice and tidy." </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>30</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Certainly! You're always welcome." </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>31</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Of course. We're running a little short on goods these days, but we ought to have more soon." </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>32</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I'm sure you'll find something to your liking. We have the finest cook in the Dyrwood." </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>33</ID>
      <DefaultText>She sighs again."I've only just taken over from the last owner, myself. I don't know what I'll do if he doesn't turn up." </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>34</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I sent Tenfrith up north to stock up. Tenfrith's our cook, you see. An artist with a good roast. But it's been days since he was supposed to return, and we haven't seen any sign of him." </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>35</ID>
      <DefaultText>"You see him safely home and I think everyone in here would sing your praises. Nobody much likes my porridge." </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>36</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I don't know how we'll manage now... We don't have much to offer these days, but Tenfrith's cooking drew in folks from miles around." She wipes away a tear. "Thank you for letting me know. I've got some savings tucked away... Maybe we can hold a service for him." </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>38</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Of course. What can I do for you?" </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>39</ID>
      <DefaultText>[Leave] "Farewell." </DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>40</ID>
      <DefaultText>"You mentioned something about a cook?" </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>41</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Yes, that'd be Tenfrith. I sent him north for supplies, and he hasn't come back yet. Bad enough that we have nothing to feed our guests, but I'm starting to worry about him." </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>44</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I'd like to know more about the Black Hound." </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>45</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Really? Well, let me see... The actual building's been here for years, but the Black Hound's fairly new. We get a lot of new faces in here, too. Fewer than we used to, I'll admit." </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>46</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I used to work the tables, actually, until the old owner up and left. Nobody's sure what happened to him. Even left his poor hound behind. That's the name, see - the Black Hound? It's still sitting upstairs pining after him. Poor old girl." </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>47</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Tenfrith's the big draw. I'm sure we'll get the big crowds back again in no time." </DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>48</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Place ended up in my hands somehow." She laughs. "My very own inn. A lot of hard work involved, but it's been worth it so far." </DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>49</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I used to work the tables, actually, until the old owner up and left. Nobody's sure what happened to him. Even left his poor hound behind." She smiles. "I'm glad it's found a new master. Was a bit sad, watching her pine all day." </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>50</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Just so you know, with what happened to the miller, we've had to raise our store prices. We aren't getting in any more grain for a while." She sighs. "Poor Trumbel..." </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>51</ID>
      <DefaultText>"You can have a look, if you've got the coin." </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>52</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Sure thing. We've been able to drop our prices some, just so you know." She smiles. "Suppose Trumbel's having more luck over at the mill." </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>53</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Say, I think I've heard of you. Just came into town, right? I hear good things." She smiles brightly. </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>54</ID>
      <DefaultText>She blinks at you. "Say, I think I've heard of you. Just came into town, right?" She glances nervously behind you. "W-well, welcome, anyhow. This is a quiet place. We keep to ourselves." </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />

    <Entry>
      <ID>55</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I heard you could help me find some reliable help." </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>56</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Hm? ...Oh! Well, I wouldn't say I can speak from experience, but we do have certain sorts coming by looking for work from time to time. If you want to hire someone on, I'd be happy to send them your way." </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />

      <ID>58</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Maybe later." </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>59</ID>
      <DefaultText>"As you like. Anything else I can do for you?" </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>60</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I could use some reliable help. Do you know of anyone looking for work?"</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>62</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Sure thing. Let me see who came by..." </DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>63</ID>
      <DefaultText>"What's the story with that dog upstairs?" </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>64</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Oh, that poor thing. She's still waiting on the old owner of the place. Thing is, I don't think he's coming back. It's been a long time, now. We've tried our best, but with things how they are, we don't have much attention to spare for a hound." </DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>66</ID>
      <DefaultText>"And then some monster killed the poor thing. Can you believe it? Who does something so terrible?" Pasca shakes her head. "I suppose we'll keep the name, even so." </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>68</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Can't we skip the payment? It's for a good cause." </DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>69</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Oh, no you don't. I've been fooled often enough. Giving them a jolly evening's worth is hardly a 'good cause'." Pasca laughs. "However they convinced you, believe me, it's not worth the copper pieces." </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>70</ID>
      <DefaultText>Pasca eyes you a moment, then sighs. "Oh, all right. I know you're one to speak true. Suppose it's only fair, what with them harvesting the grain and all. Here you are, then." </DefaultText>
