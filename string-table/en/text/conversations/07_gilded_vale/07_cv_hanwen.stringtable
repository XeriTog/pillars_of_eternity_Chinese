      <DefaultText>Gathered around the soggy timbers of a ship wreckage, men and women pick through the driftwood, snatching muddy silverware, moldy clothes, chipped pottery, and anything they can spot amongst the detritus.

All eyes turn to you as you approach.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Thank you for your understanding. The storm took all that we had - these meager supplies mean everything to us."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She blinks in disbelief. "Looting? But...this is a wreck, what value does it have?"

The men and women all turn to her, their faces frightened and worried. "Please... we need these supplies dearly. The storm took everything from us! It is not our desire to steal, but we are destitute - should we let these wares just sink to the river bottom?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Perhaps you could tell the merchant you found nothing beyond bits of driftwood. From her point of view, it will be as if the river washed it all away. Besides, how much copper will she really make by selling these rotting clothes and soiled wares?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Thank you!" She sighs, wiping sweat from her brow. "You are the first turn of good fortune to come our way in... in a very long time."

Hanwen snaps her fingers at one of her comrades, and points to a pile of supplies drying in the sun. "We don't have much, but take this as a token of our thanks."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"My cousins... they were waiting up the path, keeping an eye out for-" Hanwen's voice falls silent as she looks at the path by which you arrived. "Trouble..."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Hanwen looks up, wiping her eyes. "You speak of self-defense, well we are defending ourselves from this storm!"

Her voice rises and her face grows flush with emotion. "The floods took our entire farm! We have nothing left - nothing! No food, no roof, and now I don't even have my cousins!"

She throws up her hands in despair. "We don't want to fight you. We have lost enough already... please just leave us."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"You- you killed them!" You see Hanwen's eyes tear up before she buries her face in her hands.

The men and women around her take a step back, eyeing you cautiously.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The group trade nervous stares at you until at last, a woman in muddy clothes steps forward and speaks.

"Where are Bretal and Teran?" she asks, "They were just up along that path and... we heard fighting..." her eyes narrow and a hand moves toward a knife on her belt as she anticipates your reply.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Hanwen looks at her comrades, all nodding in agreement.

"Then you leave us with no choice."</DefaultText>
