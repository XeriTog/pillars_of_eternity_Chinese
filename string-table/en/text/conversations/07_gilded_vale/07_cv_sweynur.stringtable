      <DefaultText>A muffled shouting emerges from inside the mill. "The first of you drunkards comes through that door gets a shot between the eyes! Gods hear me, Sweynur, I'll put you down like a dog!" </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Well, someone fancies themselves a meddler, eh? What's that about? It's about Trumbel thinking he's king of the town, on account of he's got the mill to his name."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Oh, I'd bet he has. All nobility, that Trumbel. Two big, strong kids. Purest soul in all of Gilded Vale." The dwarf sneers. "Coward's sending out messengers to handle his business? Well you can go and tell him we haven't had a solid meal in days on account of him, and we can't afford a good drink on account of him, but we won't be bullied by some foreigner on account of him."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"He'll be holed up in that mill for days, the coward." The dwarf eyes you consideringly. "But here, if you want to give it a shot, then good luck. We'll owe you one if you manage it."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The dwarf barks a sour laugh. "Maybe you ought to move along before you get your feelings hurt. Here in the Dyrwood we don't let men stamp on us and call it fair. So piss off, stranger." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Hey, hold on, there." Sweynur raises his hands defensively, eyes big. "No need to get nasty. We won't go near the miller. Blazes, we haven't done a thing to him." </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>32</ID>
      <DefaultText>Sweynur considers it - briefly. He looks to the others. "Fair enough. You bring us something to wet our throats, and might be I'll feel up to trading words." </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>33</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Look, there's no sense in threatening the miller. You have him up against a wall. Maybe you could ask some of the other villagers for help." </DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>34</ID>
      <DefaultText>Sweynur eyes you for a few long moments, drinking deep from his mug. Then he sighs. "You're right. Things go on like they are, we're just going to end up hanging from that tree out there." He looks to his comrades. "Tell Trumbel we'll leave him be."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"It's like I said. The miller's in charge of the grain prices. He says they're fair, but I know for a fact that folks like Aufra pay half what we do." The dwarf sighs. "And maybe we've been a bit rough with him. But what are we supposed to do? We can't keep paying. We're going to starve, and do you think Trumbel's going to be sorry about it when we do?" </DefaultText>

      <ID>40</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Dead? How'd that-" He gives you a searching look, and seems to think better of it. "Blazes. Maybe things got a little heated, but... I always figured the old man would come around before it came to anything."</DefaultText>

      <ID>41</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Right, keep calm. We finish our drinks like nothing's the matter, and then we go grab what we can. Folks hear about this they'll be all over that grain like rats." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The dwarf looks up, blinking. "What, you serious?" He exchanges looks with his fellows, who grin hesitantly. "The old man's listened to reason?" </DefaultText>

      <ID>45</ID>
      <DefaultText>"About time. I told them he'd come around, but damn if he didn't take his time about it." He sets a few coppers on the table. "Here, buy yourself a drink, now that we can afford it. Goes for you two, as well. Drinks on me!" </DefaultText>

      <ID>46</ID>
      <DefaultText>The dwarf's jowls quiver with rage. "It's about him barely giving us anything for the wheat we bring him, and then cutting our purses when we need to buy grain. It's about farmers going hungry while some bastard gets rich off their crops." </DefaultText>

      <ID>48</ID>
      <DefaultText>The dwarf nods to you. "Not that we don't appreciate what you've done, but... You might want to be moving on, friend. Between the magistrate and this business with the grain, don't think there'll be much for you here." </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />

      <DefaultText>Sweynur's eyes go wide. He raises his hands, and lifts his chin in an effort to get away from the sharp edge of your weapon. "Hold on, now. No need to get nasty. We won't go near the miller. Blazes, we haven't done a thing to him." </DefaultText>

      <ID>63</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Ha! You think you'll get through to him when we haven't? The man's thick as a peat bog. I hear he got his soul read, found his kin used to grow sonnread trees for their Aedyran lords, up until they figured out their side was losing.
