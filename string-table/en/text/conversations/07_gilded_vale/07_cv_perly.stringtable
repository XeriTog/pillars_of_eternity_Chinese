      <DefaultText>Light blooms at the edges of your vision. You feel the sun at your back, and the weight of a bow in your hand. You know, suddenly, that you have come a long way from the Vale, hunting deer. Now, you are standing before a cavern, and the darkness extends far into its depths. Even so, your friend strides out before you, his red cloak flapping at his heels. You follow, heart hammering in your chest, as he leads you deeper into the cavern. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>There is a roar like thunder, echoing around you. Fear seizes you, casts you stumbling back towards the exit, towards light and escape. You see a glint of steel, and there is a sudden, terrible flash of agony behind your knee. You scream, stumble, fall. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>A figure drifts, suspended, in the musty air of the cavern. Its form and features blur and twist in cascading ripples of incandescence. You feel its energy eddying about your limbs, filling them with a heavy chill. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The spectral figure remains, moving in short, brief circles above the man's corpse as if tethered there by unseen threads.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You reach out a hand for the spirit. In the moment of contact you feel as if you have been struck a blow, head reeling as you tumble, helplessly, into a waiting darkness. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The vision recedes, and you are thrown back into your self with seemingly resentful force. 
The corpse lies at your feet, and the spectre lingers. In the span of energy between you both, you feel a sense of questioning, of confusion. Of anger. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Your thoughts are chaos, lanced through with pain. But in a moment of terrible clarity you see your friend look back from the mouth of the cavern, his dagger daubed in crimson to match his cloak.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Confusion leaches from the spirit in waves. Then, you feel a sudden, powerful anger, mingled with triumph. The spirit seems to fade with the force of its own exultation, growing fainter and fainter, until you are alone once more within the cave.</DefaultText>
