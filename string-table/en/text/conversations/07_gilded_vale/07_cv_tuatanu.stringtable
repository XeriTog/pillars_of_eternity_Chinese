      <DefaultText>"We just don't have the supplies. Been expecting the next delivery for near on a week, now, and haven't seen a sign of it. Have to expect they were hit by bandits. The road out east is crawling with them. Or my workers ran off with the wagon themselves, maybe, to make some coin." Tuatanu snorts. "As if that lot would dare."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"As it is, most of our weapons go to His Grace, Lord Raedric..." Tuatanu glances at the nearby guard. "...And that's as it should be. But it doesn't leave much for outsiders. We just don't have the iron." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"We send the wagon up to New Heomar with weapons, and it swings round through Loghome and the like to purchase supplies. Shortest route back is through the Black Meadow, and then north through the wilds." Tuatanu shakes his head. "Had a trader come through with word they'd made it to Loghome, but haven't heard a thing since." </DefaultText>

      <ID>30</ID>
      <DefaultText>Tuatanu nods. "Then you have my thanks. You bring those supplies back and I'll have plenty more to offer you. A discount, to start. Oh - and if you find my workers, tell them to hurry it up or they can take up farming instead." </DefaultText>

      <ID>31</ID>
      <DefaultText>Tuatanu reaches out to take the crate, raising it effortlessly onto the counter. His face splits in a broad smile. "Why, so you have! This is excellent news! We can finally get back to work - and show you real Black Hammer quality. None of these flimsy little swords." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"That it is. Been here near on twenty years, now. Seen all manner of things, over the years. Good luck and bad." Tuatanu glances at the guard standing watch along the wall. "But the Black Hammer Smithery remains." </DefaultText>

      <ID>35</ID>
      <DefaultText>Tuatanu scratches his jaw, thinking. "If you happen to be headed that way, maybe you could keep an eye out for a supply wagon. Or my shipment, at least. They'd be cutting through the Black Meadow, I expect. Only good road for it." </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />

      <ID>36</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I'll see them back safe and sound." </DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>37</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I'd appreciate your trying, anyhow. You bring back the supplies, at least, and I'll have much more to offer you. A discount to start. And if you do find my workers, you give them a good smack upside the head for me." </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>38</ID>
      <DefaultText>"And here. Some coin for your troubles, too." His pleased expression dims. "...Did you find anyone with the wagon?" </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />

    <Entry>
      <ID>39</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Bandits overtook the wagon. I doubt your people survived." </DefaultText>

      <ID>41</ID>
      <DefaultText>Tuatanu nods solemnly. "Perhaps. I certainly hope so. Poor fools." He sighs. "I'll have to hire on more hands, either way. Don't suppose you want to settle in Gilded Vale, try some delivery work?" He winks. "You have my thanks for your assistance, friend. Give me some time to work the forge and you'll have your pick of the next run of weapons." </DefaultText>

      <ID>42</ID>
      <DefaultText>Tuatanu shakes his head, running a hand over his bald pate. "Poor fools. Always told them they ought to hire some guards, instead of palming the extra coin." He sighs. "I'll have to hire on more hands. Don't suppose you want to settle in Gilded Vale, try some delivery work?" He smiles thinly.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>This aumaua man is of an impressive build, towering above the countertop. His skin is the dusky blue of the deeper oceans, and his thick arms boast corded muscle. Small ears frame a square-jawed face coated in smeared soot and arcing black tattoos alike. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Here, I'll give you a taste." He ducks behind the counter, and rises with a heavy wooden shield in hand. "Might not have had much in the way of materials to work with, but it's still Black Hammer craftsmanship. You go on and take that." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"As it is, most of our supply's been sent to Raedric's Hold, and I don't imagine I'll be getting it back anytime soon, even with him gone. It doesn't leave much for outsiders. We just don't have the iron anymore." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"He's right about the bandits. The dire situations in villages like this and the exodus to the cities has created far too many opportunities for unscrupulous sorts."</DefaultText>
