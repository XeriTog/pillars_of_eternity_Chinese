      <DefaultText>This frail old priest is hunched over a table, surrounded by scattered scrolls and parchment, examining their contents with the aid of a thick monocle. He glances up as you approach, blinking rheumy eyes. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Nedmar's brows knit together in an expression of mournful regret. "I don't know that I can. I have tried to warn Kolsc and his people of the dangers. I have, in truth, tried often to sway them from their path. My efforts do not seem to have made any difference." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Nedmar's eyes widen. With sudden vigor, he rushes forward to grasp your arm. "Oh, thank the gods. Thank you! I did not think you could... That is, I feared..." He shakes his head. "I did not want him to meet the Pale Knight so soon..." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"More visitors, then. You're not one of the acolytes. Or the guards, for that matter." His voice is a dry, quiet rasp. "Which makes you an intruder at the least. Kolsc put you up to this, I suppose?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Even poor Giacco... I thought he, at least, might be saved. But he's Osrya's now. Fodder for her experiments." He bows his head, setting his trembling hands upon the table for support. "I have narrowly escaped suspicion." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Raedric is in the grip of grief, and will not be swayed. He will bring his wrath down upon those poor prisoners." He shakes his head. "And I cannot shoulder that guilt. I cannot bear it."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"It is not that. I simply disagree with his methods. We have known each other for a long time... I remember him as a young lad. It makes it all the harder to see him act this way: impulsively, blindly." Nedmar frowns. "He and his followers have brought more harm than good, for all his good intentions." </DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>23</ID>
      <DefaultText>"But... I do not wish him harm. And so I find myself caught within their struggle for power." He raises a bony finger. "But neither Kolsc nor Raedric can resolve this crisis. They are but mortal men. We must turn to Berath. It is the Twinned God who will bring peace and balance to the souls of Gilded Vale, and it is to Berath that we must pray if we are to see Waidwen's Legacy ended." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Nedmar studies you quietly for a moment. "My eyes may be failing me, but my wits have not. Kolsc has recruited what allies he can, and he has begun to strike against the keep in earnest." </DefaultText>

      <ID>26</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Kolsc is unwilling to grasp certain truths. Nor does he understand what it is that keeps Raedric in power. He will need much guidance, if he means to take Raedric's place. I... can only hope he would listen." </DefaultText>

      <ID>29</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I hoped he might grow within the church. Take my place when I grew too old to serve Lord Raedric." A bitter note enters his voice. "But he took an interest in Kolsc's efforts. His vain rebellion. I could not keep him from leaving." </DefaultText>

    <Entry>

      <DefaultText>"And now... he has joined Kolsc against our lord, and lingers in the dungeons. I fear he may already have fallen victim to Osrya's evil designs."</DefaultText>

      <ID>31</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Osrya... a bright young woman, corrupted by the teachings of the animancers. She has filled Lord Raedric's head with blasphemous notions and false hope, preying upon his desire to guide his people." </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>32</ID>
      <DefaultText>"And he has been foolish enough to listen. Raedric has given Osrya leave to conduct what experiments she will. Now the lowest reaches of the keep are fouled with the smell of rot. Who knows what souls dwell, lamenting, in that darkness?" </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>33</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I... begged Lord Raedric's forgiveness on my acolyte's behalf. But I think I have only delayed Giacco's fate." He shakes his head. "He is at Osrya's mercy, now." </DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>34</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I... I could give you the means to enter Raedric's chapel, below. That would put you beside his throne room." Nedmar's voice trembles. "But I cannot risk it while Giacco is in danger." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Be cautious. Osrya wields powerful sorceries, and she has a fondness for cruel traps. I don't doubt she will be a terrible foe if angered." Nedmar clasps his hands together. "Gods guide you." </DefaultText>

      <ID>42</ID>
      <DefaultText>Nedmar straightens a little, though his hands tremble. "Would you act as rashly as Kolsc? Threaten an old priest? I will not aid you in this until you have rescued Giacco. That is all I will say." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Nedmar pulls away, collecting himself. "Here - what I promised you in return." He pulls a large iron key from the pocket of his robe, and hands it to you.
