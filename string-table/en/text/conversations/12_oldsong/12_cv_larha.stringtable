      <DefaultText>"Glamfellen. Worshipers of Rymrgand, they claim. Simply looters and defilers by another name - that's the truth."

The spearhead flashes as she shakes it at the door. "They disappeared behind the doors of Noonfrost, and now our lake turns to ice and the cold creeps ever closer."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She releases a gasp of relief. "You've accomplished a great service... for the Fangs and for me."

Larha takes another deep breath. "I was wrong about you, estramor. I did not see you truly. Please, accept a gift worthy of your honor and skill."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She squeezes the spearhead in her hand. Blood trickles from her palm.

"The blame lies with me for trusting an estramor." Red drops spatter the sand as she points. "Go. And may your feet never again stray near this place."</DefaultText>

      <ID>26</ID>
      <DefaultText>She nods slowly. "As I suspected. I'm grateful that she lives, but she can't survive long in such cold. And the anamfatha will not permit an intervention when the blame lies with our recklessness."

She averts her eyes. "I would not often ask such a favor of an estramor, but if you find a way to free Alwah, you would have my gratitude. And that of all the Fangs."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>An orlan woman stands ankle-deep in the sand, sharpening a spearhead.

"You must be Bethwl's new estramor. Truth, when I heard she'd let another in, I almost went to the Passage of the Six myself to share words." She points the flint spearhead at you.</DefaultText>

"You must be Bethwl's new estramor. Truth, when I heard she'd let another in, I almost went to the Passage of the Six myself to share words." She points the flint spearhead at you.

Her hand slowly falls to her side. "But my brethren say you've done right by us. Not like these snow-blind wanderers from the frozen lands."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She draws her whetstone across the spearhead. "We believe in action over talk, and many of our number are more eager to exchange blood than words. 

"Thankfully, however, the tension has lessened due to your intervention with the beasts."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Chaos pervades the Maw, and more then ever due to this stalemate between the beasts." She shakes her head. "But Desthwn refuses to intervene, and many itch to settle the matter over blood."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>An orlan woman stands ankle-deep in the sand, sharpening a spearhead.

"Another wanderer from the frozen lands?" She points the flint spearhead at you. "Bethwl may be wide-eyed and soft-headed, but I'm not so easily fooled by you estramorwn. I've got my eye on you."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She digs a trench in the sand with one bare foot. "Yet Bethwl is timid, and she has convinced the other anamfatha that we must respect these estramorwn and their traditions. No matter what mischief guides their hands."

She raises her head, slowly looking back toward the entrance. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I sent my own sister, one of my finest scouts, to sniff out the pale elves' corruption. I was certain the anamfatha could not ignore the defilement in Noonfrost once Alwah's own eyes had seen it, but she still hasn't returned."

She looks away. "Now, I bear the responsibility for her fate. And I can't send the Fangs after her without openly defying the anamfatha."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She gives you a guarded look. "I don't dare to hope - whatever catastrophe has befallen Noonfrost does not feel like the work of kith. But nothing would bring me greater joy than seeing her again." She glances at the sand and frowns. "I would take any assistance you can give."</DefaultText>
