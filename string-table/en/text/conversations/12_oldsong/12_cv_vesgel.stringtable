      <DefaultText>The pale elf searches you with ice-blue eyes. She shifts and knits her fingers together. "Welcome to Noonfrost. Most of the temple is currently closed for sacred ceremonies to Rymrgand."

She forces a smile and waves to the eastern doorway. "The shrine is to your right. You're welcome to make your offerings to Rymrgand there, but the rest of the temple is off-limits."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The barest flush rises in her pale cheeks. "As I said, only the shrine in the eastern wing is open. The rest of the temple is closed to visitors right now.

"I suggest that you make your devotions there and leave."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She stiffens. "Rymrgand is the god of winter. It's been many years since his temple was attended, so there's nothing strange about a little chill around the place now."

She lowers her head. "If it bothers you, then perhaps you should go."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"As I said, we're in the middle of sacred ceremonies." She enunciates carefully. "They're rather complex, and we don't permit outsiders to witness them." She glances at the elves over her shoulder. 

"Others of my clan get rather touchy about them. Which is why you should visit the shrine and take your leave."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"He's the god of cold, entropy, and collapse. Many see him as a harsh god, but few recognize that he also gives life in his own way. All things wind to a merciful end in his shadow, only to feed creation elsewhere."

She frowns, gnawing her lip. "But he is a silent god, and his ways are mysterious. To follow him is to accept inevitability without explanation." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"My clan journeyed from the White that Wends to pay homage to Rymrgand here at Noonfrost. We'd learned that this place had been abandoned for several years, and we felt it our duty to tend to one of our god's oldest temples."

She rolls her shoulders back. "It has been a long journey, but Rymrgand demands endurance. No doubt he will reward us for ours."</DefaultText>
