      <DefaultText>"Salutations, estramor," the orlan chirps in a sing-song voice.

"I am known as Delem, chanter of Oldsong. I trust you are enjoying the beauty of this sacred place."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I sing to entertain Oldsong's visitors but alas... the crowds have thinned into little more than a trickle. The chill wind from Rymrgand's temple is driving people away. Now I sing but nobody listens... my music is without purpose."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />

    <Entry>
      <ID>11</ID>
      <DefaultText>"But I know of a solution - a way for me to make my songs warm and passionate, countering Rymrgand's incessant chill!"

The orlan smiles and reaches out with a grasping motion. "All I need are a few rare song birds! I could eat them and absorb their musical energy. With that kind of musical prowess in my soul, I could sing a song that could bring back the merry crowds."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Oldsong is a sacred site, home to many of the Builders' finest works. Galawain's Maw, Hylea's Temple, and Rymrgand's Temple - known as Noonfrost - can be found here."

He looks you up and down with a smile. "Visitors are a rare sight in Oldsong. Whatever it is that brought you here, be thankful you have the privilege to see this place with your own eyes."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Delem's eyes widen with delight. "Splendid!" he exclaims with clapping hands.

"For my song to be pitch-perfect, I will need a T&#238;am, a bird often found throughout Twin Elms - often in high tree nests but some have been domesticated. I'll also need a Shardwing. Shardwings prefer to nest in adra formations - suits their natural camouflage the best."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He looks at the bird for a moment before snapping its neck with one quick twist.

"That wasn't so hard!" he exclaims with a smile before tossing the bird into his mouth. He chews for a long, uncomfortable minute, pausing to yank beak bits and legs out from the bloody mass of feathers in his maw.</DefaultText>

      <ID>27</ID>
      <DefaultText>He takes the bird from you and strokes its tail feathers. "This was someone's pet?"

      <ID>28</ID>
      <DefaultText>He takes the bird from you and strokes its plumage "A bountiful find! I remember the first time I heard the Shardwing's crisp melody..."

He wraps his fist around the bird and raises it to his mouth before pausing. "Guess I just... eat it whole?" </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"What a find!" Delem takes the small bird from you and holds it to his ear as it warbles. "And he's so talkative! How cute!"</DefaultText>

      <ID>31</ID>
      <DefaultText>"What? On&#373;en said that?" Delem's jaw clenches shut as he folds his arms with a huff. "But what of all the other chanters that told me otherwise!"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Delem smacks his lips as he licks a bloody index finger. "That's three! I can feel it now - it's like a warmth in my lungs that's too joyous to contain!"

He clears his throat and then whistles three discordant notes.

"Well, I'll no doubt need to hone my newfound musical prowess."</DefaultText>

      <ID>33</ID>
      <DefaultText>Delem coughs a feather into his hand, grimaces with a shiver, and slaps his hands together to shake loose bits of bird viscera.

      <ID>35</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Oh, and most importantly, if I plan on hitting those high notes, I'm going to need a Cloudsinger. Those little warblers can only be found in the highest mountain peaks."

"Many thanks, estramor. Bring me these birds and I'll sing like Hylea herself!"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The orlan stares at you, dumbfounded, before rolling his eyes and lecturing you. "Eating the muscles of animal makes you... stronger, right? And if you consume green stalks, do you not take on their pungent smell - even down to the water you pass?"

He smiles, pleased with his reasoning. "Just as one cannot sweat if one is parched, I cannot sing without a nourished soul. It's all very basic, did your parents teach you nothing of the food-droppings cycle?"</DefaultText>

      <ID>46</ID>
      <DefaultText>Delem nods with a sigh. "Indeed, my voice is still tired and my heart still aches for inspiration. The lyrical souls of the finest birds would make a fine muse, morsel, and medicine."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Yes. His name is the Talonted Mr. Beaker and Llensi, his owner, loves him. Maybe you'll taste how much she loves him when you bite into his little bird skull."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Can't have it trying to peck its way out of me," he muses as he swings the bird overhead and slams it to the ground.

He then takes the twitching avian, pulls it in two, and quickly chews and swallows the two bloody halves.

"Oddly astringent, surprisingly salty."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Delem squeezes the bird, places its head in his mouth, and silences the bird with one swift bite.

After several moments of chewing and trying to keep feathers from falling out of his mouth, Delem gulps down the songbird.</DefaultText>

      <ID>60</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Nonsense!" Delem shakes his head in disbelief. "I know a man who swears by the practice! This has been part of how master chanters refine their craft for... for ages! Surely a wise woman such as herself would be familiar with the folklore and know that I speak of time-honored truths!"</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>67</ID>
      <DefaultText>His posture stiffens and he looks at you with a frown. "Well, I think she just said that because she has a soft spot for birds."

"Besides, songbirds were what the chanters of old would eat - why tamper with tradition?"</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>68</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Well of course I care," Delem says, his posture stiffening.

"And I respect his wisdom but... I suppose I put more faith in what my singing instructor told me. I appreciate you telling me what On&#373;en said, but I am set on my plan."</DefaultText>

      <ID>69</ID>
      <DefaultText>Delem frowns but nods at you, his body slumping. "Guess it does sound like wishful thinking when you put it that way."

He lets out a long sigh that ends with a shrug. "Thank you for setting me straight on this... I feel silly for having asked in the first place."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>73</ID>
      <DefaultText>"You're saying I should consume a sparrow hawk! Oh wait... oh I see..."

Delem frowns, his posture slackens. "But maybe the sparrow hawk doesn't have a soul and that's why..."

He shrugs, his face blushing. "You're right... this is silly... I'm just desperate for creative passion and I'm walking the wrong path to find it."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>74</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Well I'd like to see YOU practice singing as much as-"

Delem falls silent and looks at you sheepishly. "Singing better because I eat some birds? Guess it really DOES sound like wishful thinking."</DefaultText>

      <ID>75</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Thank you my friend. I don't need rare song birds, I just need to find some inspiration from within."

He bows to you with a pained smile. "If you'll pardon me, I should stop delaying and write a new song!"</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>76</ID>
      <DefaultText>The bird chirps and squawks as Delem holds it at arm's length.

"Hylea forgive me... this feels wrong somehow."</DefaultText>

      <ID>80</ID>
      <DefaultText>Delem tosses the bird into the air, smiling as the songbird takes flight and floats into the sky.

"This hunt is over," he mutters with pained smile. "I'm sorry to have sent you on a wild chase, only to release the quarry in the end."</DefaultText>

      <ID>81</ID>
      <DefaultText>He purses his lips to whistle, creating a sour imitation of the songbird's melodic tune.

"Thank you my friend, I feel laden with inspiration for a new song now.... though it seems I'll need to practice a great deal if I wish to mimic such beautiful music!"</DefaultText>
