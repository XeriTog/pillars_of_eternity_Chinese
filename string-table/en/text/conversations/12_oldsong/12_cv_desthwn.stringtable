      <DefaultText>A wiry elven man paces the cavern, his face etched with worry lines and his hand irritably thumping his hip. He looks up at you, and his exasperation deepens.

"Look, estramor, this is no place for sightseeing. The beasts of Galawain's Maw are dangerous, and now more than ever." He sighs and shakes his head. "If you want to see some pretty Glanfathan places, go to Elms' Reach."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"And Sul remains champion. Many of the Fangs are gladdened to see her stay. Perhaps it's Galawain's way of telling us to remember our roots and prize our cunning as hunters.

      <DefaultText>"And now Oernos is champion of the Maw. I know more than a few Fangs who will be happy with that. Perhaps it's a sign from Galawain himself that we need to focus on building our strength and forging new paths.

      <DefaultText>"I don't know what I expected, but I didn't expect both beasts to die. Still, I suppose there's logic in making room for new blood. If neither was willing to confront the other, then perhaps neither was worthy.

"Now that both Sul and Oernos are gone, I expect another beast will seek the Maw soon. It will be good to see what Galawain sends."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Yes, a den of beasts sacred to the Lord of the Hunt himself. Historically, the greatest predator of Eir Glanfath has claimed the back of the Maw as its lair. Lately, however, there's been some dispute as to who should occupy that position." He glances up and into the cavern. "And it's leading to discord among our hunters."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I'm the leader of the Fangs. We're an order of hunters and warriors devoted to Galawain, and we see that the places of the Builders remain pure. Not truly a tribe, but we do gather - and argue - like one. Our members come from all of the tribes, but most of us were born Three-Tusk Stelgaer, Fisher Crane, and Keepers of the Stone, naturally."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"There's never been a more cunning hunter than Sul, but some say she's losing her edge. Oernos, on the other hand, is all edge, and many of our number think he's the rightful successor."

His fingers drum a restless rhythm on his thigh. "Blood's simmering. It's going to boil over if a little doesn't spill soon."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He resumes his pacing. "And this waiting... It's not the deliberate, watchful waiting of a hunter lying in ambush. It's stagnation. Tedium. Hoping for something to happen."

He clenches his hands into fists. "But I'm powerless to act. One half of the Fangs will cry favoritism if I try to drag the lioness out myself."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>His tired eyes go wide. "From the Clever Hound himself?" He looks you up and down. "If you truly have Galawain's blessing, I won't stand in your way. And if you don't..." He grins. "Then I suspect the beasts will make short work of you."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Yes, and from what I heard, it was a good fight. I don't know how you managed it, but thank you. Your way brought honor to Galawain and satisfaction to the Fangs.

      <DefaultText>He gives you a heavy iron key. "We don't normally permit outsiders to venture into the Maw, but you understand that you do so at your own risk. And Sul's lions are likely to attack intruders on sight.

"Still, perhaps you can coax her into fighting the bear. Do whatever you can to end this stalemate."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"The Maw has always been home to one great predator. Every so often, a challenger comes along, and the two battle for territory.

"But Sul remains in her den, and Oernos can't confront her there. Now, two mighty predators - and their kin - hunt from the same stock. It's thinning the herds, and it's thinning patience around here, too."</DefaultText>
