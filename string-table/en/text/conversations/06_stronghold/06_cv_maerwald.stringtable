      <DefaultText>A large, liver-spotted man, barrel-chested and paunchy, cowers in the far corner of the room, his white hair a tangled, stringy mess. He covers his face and chest with trembling hands, unable to look in your direction.

      <DefaultText>All at once, he stops shaking, a sudden calmness falling over him. His head tilts forward slightly, and he looks you dead in the eye, like a cornered animal about to pounce. His voice turns suddenly raspy.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The old man turns his body away and has another muttered, sputtering argument, facing the wall.

When he turns back toward you, he has taken a confident stance, and his chest is puffed out like a soldier's. A new strength enters his voice. "Maerwald will speak with you. But you will maintain your distance or you'll have me to answer to."</DefaultText>

      <ID>11</ID>
      <DefaultText>The man's posture folds, and the hands he'd held strongly at his sides a moment ago resume their original tremors. His voice is feeble and tentative.

      <DefaultText>He nods, still half-distracted, eyeing the door behind you. "A window. Window to the ether, where spirits dwell. Peer and reach into it, speak and listen through it. 

"A Watcher sees souls. Reads them. Knows their pasts. Souls of the living, souls of the dead. An empath." He exhales feebly, his breath wheezing. "And the souls see them back.

      <DefaultText>In your mind's eye, the bond seems to you as a frayed rope, ghostly and alive, its frayed ends writhing like tidepool anemones, and you find that if you concentrate on it, you have the ability to manipulate its strands.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Maerwald's body lies inert. You can feel his soul lingering there, uncertain.

There is something unique about this soul in this place. A bond formed in decades of inhabitance and lordship that feels somehow palpable to you, as though even in death, the keep knows its former master, and the former master remembers his keep.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The frayed pieces twist and fuse, and as the bond strengthens, the fibers become metal, and the rope becomes a chain.

You watch as Maerwald's soul recedes into the floor, melding with it, spreading thin across it until it is one with the entire place, a silent guardian.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Strand by strand, the connections fly apart like the overstressed strings of some ethereal instrument. With the tearing of the final string, the rope becomes liquid and dissolves from your awareness.

Maerwald's soul hovers near you, a vortex of strife and discord, but there is something else there beneath it - something like relief. His soul passes through one of the walls and is gone.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You turn both ends of the rope towards you, bringing them into contact with your essence, and as you do, the fibers turn to copper, and through them an energy is conducted into your being. 

You are traveling downward now, beneath the place you stand, seeing places dank and cobwebbed and malignant, like some untended garden overgrown with flora and overrun with vermin. Below everything, at the very bottom, you glimpse for an instant some being you can't quite make out, presiding over it all with brilliant and terrifying power.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>One image remains in your perception. A circular room with a stone table that resembles the sun, in an area guarded by suits of armor that move of their own volition. It is deep, not far from the very bottom. There is a door in that room, invisible to all but the most fastidious of eyes, and beyond it, something shimmering, something powerful...

As the image fades, you find yourself in Caed Nua once more. Maerwald's soul is nowhere to be seen.</DefaultText>
