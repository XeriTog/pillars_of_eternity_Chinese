      <DefaultText>As you draw nearer, the apparition in front of you resolves into an elven woman. Her stringy hair is tied back, and she tugs at a loose thread on her apron. There's a distant, hollow look in her eyes until she notices you.

A frail smile descends like a veil over her face. "Been out playing soldier again, have we? Go wash up and come help me shuck these peas."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She turns from you long enough to produce a basket that, like her, is shimmering and semi-transparent. "And no complaints. You've got to eat your vegetables if you want to grow up strong and be a real soldier one day.

"Just like we agreed, right?" She watches you out of the corner of her eye.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Soldiers are important people." Her voice rises and falls as she bends over the basket. "They defend the weak. And punish the wicked."

She sighs, a spectral strand of hair fluttering. "You're too young to understand now, but there are lots of wicked people." She snaps off a shell with a torn fingernail. "People like the man who murdered your father." She crushes another husk between finger and thumb.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Her brittle smile snaps. "Before you were born, the Glanfathans attacked settlers like us. They said we'd knocked over some of their special adra rocks. That's why they call it the Broken Stone War.

"They got very angry, and so they came into our villages and killed many people." A pod slips out of her grasp, and she jabs the side of her finger with a jagged thumbnail. She says nothing as the skin slowly turns from white to red. "Your father was one of them."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"That's what I said." Her voice is low and hoarse, and her hand is frozen over the basket. Something dark and empty clouds over her eyes.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She drops the basket and turns away, dabbing at her face with the corner of her apron. "That's why you'll be a soldier one day. To protect. And to avenge."

She stares at the trickle of blood on her finger. "Why don't you go back out and play? I'll finish up here."</DefaultText>
