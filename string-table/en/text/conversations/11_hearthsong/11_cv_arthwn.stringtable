      <DefaultText>A lanky hunter grooms his stubble, a patched fuzz of blonde hairs, while listening attentively to a young elven woman. She whispers in his reddened ears and giggles. With his head still lowered, he flashes a wide smile in return.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"My tribesmen have told me that you're to speak the truth about Fîorm's exile." He combs his sparse stubble, darting a glance to the elven woman. "Well, Arthwn doesn't hide from the truth. Ask, and I'll answer."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Arthwn looks down and licks his lips. "Fîorm..." He pushes the blonde bristles away from the edges of his mouth. "Every tribe knows his prowess. A hunter of great name. But, this time he fell behind."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Arthwn avoids looking at you directly as you approach. Scratching his patchy stubble, he searches the ground as if for an answer. "I don't know how, or why... but you came when we most needed a friend."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"We're young, the youngest tribe in Eir Glanfath." Arthwn hesitates for a moment, scratching his beard, and then spreads his long legs apart. "But we're not weak. The other tribes have their history, and now we, the Twice-Split Arrows, are making our own."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The hunter's wide smile retreats behind his uneven stubble. "You... I never..." His skin reddens through the patches of fuzz as he stumbles for words.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The hunter notices you. He clears his throat and straightens his back, adopting an air of dignity. "I've been expecting you."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The young elven woman looks up to the hunter and grabs his shoulder. "Arthwn, with you we'll make our name. This, I know!"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Arthwn puffs his chest and pounds it with a fist. "We're true Glanfathans, true hunters. I've proven our worth." His patches of golden stubble sparkle alongside a glowing smile. "It was me, not Fîorm, who killed the giant stelgaer."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"We spotted the giant stelgaer on the Sentinel's Ridge, above the waterfall of The Northweald. It was stalking for prey." Arthwn lightly shakes his head. "Fîorm wanted us to split. He'd lure the beast to the river and I'd flank it."</DefaultText>

      <ID>22</ID>
      <DefaultText>The hunter scratches his flushed earlobe. "But the beast didn't come down to the river bank. So, we tried to circle it on the ridge. I climbed faster. And there it was, ready to pounce on me!" Arthwn thrusts his fist forward "I pierced flesh, mid air! Rolled over, and stabbed at it again, and again!"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"...and, it was dead." The hunter pushes his mustache back and looks up. "Fîorm couldn't believe he didn't earn the kill, not even a cut. He said he'd not return with the shame of losing to a Twice-Split Arrow." Arthwn sighs. "I pleaded, but he was a Keeper of the Stone. He'd not listen. And, now he's... exiled. Who knows where."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The elven woman takes a step back, staring at Arthwn with her mouth open in disbelief. "You wouldn't..." She quickly looks at you, and then turns back to the hunter. "Do you understand what the tribes will think of us, of our people?!"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Her burst shakes Arthwn out of his standstill. "They already step on us as if we were filthy maggots! We're the Twice-Split Arrows. We're broken!" The huntress lowers her head, and he turns back to you. A look of despair maddens his eyes.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Arthwn bites his lip. A drop of saliva glistens on his golden stubble. He wipes it with the back of his hand and gives you a supplicant look. "For the sake of my people, speak for us to the anamenfath. Speak the..." His eyes dart to the side as if pointing to the elven woman behind him. "For us... speak your truth."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Our hope remains thanks to you." The hunter looks up. His smile beams from one reddened ear to the other. "My tribe will never forget what you've done for us. I'll never forget."</DefaultText>

      <ID>35</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Please, I know it's a humble token. Not worth what you've given us..." Arthwn unwraps an elongated bundle of animal skins. "We have very little. But here's one of our finest weapons, fit for the best hunters in Eir Glanfath. Take it, and do the Twice-Split Arrows this one more honor."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The hunter bows and turns around. After a few long strides, Arthwn glances back, a wide smile sparkling across his patched golden fuzz.</DefaultText>
