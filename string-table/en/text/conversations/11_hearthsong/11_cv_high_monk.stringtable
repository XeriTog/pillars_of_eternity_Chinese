      <DefaultText>The monk massages his temples, his face buried in his palm. As you approach, he looks up. "This room needs a proper door," he mutters.

"My brothers and I rented this space that we may have some measure of privacy in this foreign land. Perhaps you could find another room here in the inn..."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Hand me that!" the monk exclaims as he snatches the missive from your grasp. Almost immediately, his face turns red, "I mean, please - this is of great importance!"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He turns over the missive, peeling back the broken seal. He glares at you, his brow furrowed with anger. "You've destroyed the seal! You've invaded the privacy of our order!"

The monk throws the missive to the ground and raises his fists into a fighting stance.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Briefly opening his mouth to answer, the monk swallows his words. He looks you up and down, carefully choosing his response. "My brothers and I were having a private discussion in a room we rented for our use. Please, there is a tavern full of people who would provide you with the banter you seek."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The monk's eyes widen, his fists curl in a crackling barrage of popping joints. "Robes like ours, you say? Was he carrying anything? Did he tell you anything - hand you anything? Please, we've been waiting for another of our order to meet us here and if you found him..."

All eyes fall to the floor as the monks begin to whisper chants, in unison, to their fallen friend.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The monk bows as you approach. He speaks in an aggravated tone, unable to hide his impatience.

"If you want something, speak your peace - otherwise, leave us be. We are not being loud or quarrelsome, and we are within our rights to be here."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Breaking the seals, the monk unrolls the handwritten scroll contained within and quickly reads the message, his lips breathlessly mouthing the text.

He turns to address his brothers, "My brethren, the Archmartyr has sent word! At long last, we now have what we need."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Thank you, stranger," the monk says, folding his hands in front of him as he bows deeply. "Your honest soul is to be applauded. I admit I was surprised... when you handed me the message, I expected the seals to be broken."

The monk turns red, his face smiling for the first time, "I am glad to see common decency is not yet lost from this world."

He reaches into the folds of his robes. "Here, your honesty must be rewarded."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The monk's fist remains poised to strike for several seconds as the monks all freeze in place. At last, the leader of the monks lowers his fist. "I... apologize for my quick judgment."

The monk reaches into his satchel. "Please, allow me to compensate you for bringing this missive to its intended recipient."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The monk stares at you, wide-eyed and flabbergasted. "You don't remember? You came across a dying man and just... forgot what happened?"

      <DefaultText>The monk sighs, his gaze falls to the floor. "Then his errand has come to ruin," he says quietly.

"I thank you, traveler, for conveying this news to us. Long have we waited for word of our brother - at least we know more of his fate. Now if you will bid us our privacy, my brethren and I have much to discuss."
