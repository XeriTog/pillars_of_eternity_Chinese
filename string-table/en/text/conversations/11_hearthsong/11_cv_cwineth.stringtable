      <DefaultText>A slender woman in dusty leathers locks eyes with you. "It's good to see someone from more... civilized lands around here." Her unkempt hair sprouts in wavy black tufts. Despite the fine features that sculpt her face, a cleft chin completes her boyish appearance.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Cwineth hides in the tall underbrush. Twigs poke out of her hair. Chunks of dried mud cling waist-high to her leather leggings. "Quiet. Keep low." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"My friends have drawn some... unwanted attention." Cwineth looks to both sides, scanning for uninvited listeners.

"Glanfathan scouts... and not just any mob of local zealots, the Fangs!" She pauses to let the name settle in the air. "The Fangs are a brutal, relentless bunch - eager to make an example of troublesome outsiders."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Cwineth, her gloved hands half-buried on the waves of her rebellious hair, watches your approach incredulous. "You did it!" Her dimples frame a beaming smile.

She lets out a sigh of relief and wags her finger at you. "We'll be chanting your name back in the Gift. Everyone will know what you've done for us, I promise."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Cwineth nods enthusiastically, "I was hoping you'd say that." She removes the gloves from her hands, stowing them in her back pocket.

"When you spend as much time as I do in the ruins, you learn to strike first... and to strike without warning."

She holds her estoc out in front of her, its blade parallel to the ground. "The key is efficiency of movement."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Only a fool works for charity," she says with a wink.

She counts out a large sum of copper. "I wish I had the coin to match my gratitude, but this will have to suffice."

With that, she nods and turns to leave. "Thank you again my friend, we will not forget what you did for us this day."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Cwineth's eyes widen. "If... are you-?" She shakes her head and smiles, her dimples turning flush.

"Your generosity humbles me, but I pay my debts. If you change your mind, meet me at Expedition Hall in Defiance Bay."

She bows deeply. "Until then my friend, I bid you farewell."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I'm learning firsthand the many shortcomings of Glanfathan hospitality." Her gloved hands come to rest on the pommel of a long estoc cinched low on her hip.

"I can almost forgive the hostility toward outsiders, but the temperate taverns and these watered-down drinks... inexcusable."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I hope I don't seem too forward, but I need to help my friends and you look like the right person for the job." A sly smile carves a dimple on her cheek.

"Which is to say, you're not Glanfathan... making you the closest thing I've got to an ally in this paranoid land." She gives you a coquettish sideways glance. "And allies, well, they help each other, do they not?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"As for why I need your help," her smile widens as she speaks, "I need someone to warn the expedition that trouble is coming... and I need someone ready to fight, if it comes to that."

She taps her hand on the pommel of her estoc. "With any luck, we'll reach my friends before the Fangs do. But if not, the Fangs have a reputation to uphold, so this might require spilling blood."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I hope I don't seem too forward, but I've heard of you." A sly smile carves a dimple on her cheek. "You're famed among the Dozens... and that makes us allies." She gives you a coquettish sideways glance. "And allies, well, they help each other, do they not?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I like to think we're on a mission of reclamation." Cwineth darts a shrewd smile. "It is said that our armies left behind many valuables in their hasty retreat from Eir Glanfath at the end of the War of Black Trees."

"So the way I see it, we're simply gathering up what our ancestors left behind. I doubt the Glanfathans agree with me on this," she adds with a dimpled grin.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The woman pats the dust off her leggings and gives you an exaggerated curtsy. "Where did I leave my ambassadorial manners?" She flashes a mocking smile. "I am Cwineth, pleasure to meet you."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Cwineth's smiles with an overt display of dimples. "Excellent! I knew I could count on you."

She leans in and whispers. "Assuming the Fangs didn't already get them, my friends should now be at or around the pilgrim's trail in the Northweald. The plan was to camp along a trail leading to a temple of Hylea."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Find my comrades, warn them the Fangs are coming, and help them clear out of the forest. I'll head out first on my own to see if I can't lead the Fangs astray and buy us some time."

She pulls her estoc a few inches out of its scabbard and cracks a smile. "If the gods smile on us, we won't have to draw steel. Should it come to that, I'm glad you are on our side."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"My expedition set out from Defiance Bay heading directly east to cross into Glanfathan lands. I split off once we arrived at The Bael, the natural frontier between our nations."

"The plan was for me to keep my eyes on the Glanfathans while the main group scoured the target area. For days, we eluded them." She walks her fingers over the back of her leather glove, leaving a trail on its dusty surface. "But the Fangs got wise to our presence."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Cwineth nods, her lip lower lip crushed beneath her teeth. "I wasn't fast enough. Pox-ridden Fangs... Magran burn them all."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"The Fangs must have caught the scent and rushed the group." She begins to run her gloved fingers over her hair and stops. The pressure snaps one of the twigs stuck on her black curls. "Some of my friends are still alive, but the Fangs have them surrounded."</DefaultText>

      <ID>44</ID>
      <DefaultText>Cwineth looks down to her feet, shaking her head slowly. "I cut a decoy path, set false camp fires, and dusted over every footprint I could find... It didn't slow them much."</DefaultText>

      <ID>45</ID>
      <DefaultText>Cwineth nods. "Maybe you can find a way around the Fangs - there's got to be another way up to that ridge."

She wipes away the sweat from her brow, her glove leaving behind a dirty smudge. "You aren't dressed like my men... perhaps you could try talking to the Fangs? They might not think you're with us."</DefaultText>

      <ID>46</ID>
      <DefaultText>"The expedition..." Cwineth brings her hand back to the pommel of her estoc. "Or what remains of it, has taken cover in some ruins above these cliffs. The Fangs must be toying with them, or letting them starve a bit before the next attack. We need to act or they're as good as dead."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She scratches her cleft chin with her free hand and gives you a measuring look. "But, you're the type to deserve more than just praise. Coin? Weaponry?" She rubs her gloved fingers together. "Or if nothing tangible suits your fancy, I'd gladly share my skills with you."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Cwineth nods with a smile and rummages through her pack. "Our treasure hunt wasn't a total wash. We found a few relics along the way and," she pulls out a canvas bundle, "I think this will suit your needs."

With a wink, she turns and takes her leave.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Esmar watches Cwineth disappear into the thick foliage. He turns to face you. "I'm ready... I think" He unwraps the locket from his hand and ties it around his neck. "At least some of my men are leaving Eir Glanfath alive."</DefaultText>

      <ID>57</ID>
      <DefaultText>Her posture stiffens at the question. "It was my turn to handle far patrol. I spotted the Fangs on my trek back to camp. I knew that rejoining the main group would risk leading the enemy right back to the expedition. I know the woods and I know how to stay quiet... but I didn't want to stake my friends' lives on my ability to sneak past expert hunters like the Fangs."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Just setting foot in Eir Glanfath is a good way to offend the tribes. I don't know how they picked up our trail - I suspect one of our newer scouts didn't cover his tracks well enough. When I spotted the Fangs, they were retracing a path the expedition had taken days before."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"If they noticed me warning my friends, we'd have been overrun."

Cwineth tilts her head to the side and points to you with a grin. "But if they notice me AND some reinforcements... like say, you... well at least then we can scare them off or put up a good a fight."</DefaultText>

      <ID>61</ID>
      <DefaultText>Cwineth frowns and blinks at you several times. "You'll forgive me if I'm not sympathetic with facepainters and their barbaric laws. I'm not pretending that what we're doing is noble, I just don't believe trespassing is a crime that warrants execution."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She grabs your hand, squeezing it. "Please help... I already have enough friends to bury."

Cwineth releases your hand and crouches down into the vegetation, blending back into the brush.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She walks you through several footwork drills that focus on quiet footfalls and measured breathing.

"Place all your weight on the final step when you're ready to strike!" she yells for emphasis as she demonstrates a swift, silent lunge.

As you follow her examples, she nods in satisfaction. "I think you've got the grasp of it. I'm honored I could teach you something new." She half-curtsies, and turns to take her leave.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Her smile cracks for a moment as she looks off to the distance. "Don't know if we'll see Esmar again, but his sacrifice has saved the expedition. We couldn't have negotiated our way out of this without your help."

      <ID>69</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I realize Esmar will need to be your prisoner if we are to honor the agreement. An odd arrangement but it'll save the expedition."

She shrugs and gives you a sly smile. "Besides, I'm sure your dungeon is far more... enjoyable... than whatever the Fangs do with their prisoners."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Cwineth smiles at your approach as one hand idly twirls a lock of black hair. "Finally decided you want your reward? What'll it be - coin, weapons, or training?"</DefaultText>
