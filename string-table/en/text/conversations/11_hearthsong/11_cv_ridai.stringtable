      <DefaultText>Sensing your approach, an agitated elven hunter suddenly drops his conversation and turns to face you. "What kind of courtesy have you learned in your filthy homeland?" A red stripe of paint gleams, pearly with sweat, from cheekbone to cheekbone. "We speak of Glanfathan matters. Begone!"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"My brother." The hunter's heavy breathing pauses for a moment. "My brother Fîorm is the greatest hunter of our tribe. He set out on a blood-hunt but hasn't returned. And now, Arthwn, that puny liar! He claims that my brother..." Rîdaî clenches his fists.</DefaultText>

      <ID>13</ID>
      <DefaultText>Rîdaî hesitates for a moment. He wipes the sweat off his face, leaving traces of red paint on his hands. "I'm ready to share the truth with the anamenfath." He looks up. "And I'll make sure that so is Arthwn."</DefaultText>

      <ID>17</ID>
      <DefaultText>Rîdaî scowls. His stripe of paint curves like an angry wound. "Exiled! In shame! For losing to him during the blood-hunt! Can you believe this... liar?!"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Rîdaî stares into nothingness. He breaks the silence in a grave voice. "I'll remain here and wait for the anamfatha to summon us."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Rîdaî fixes his eyes on you, two glowing embers over the blood-red stripe painted across his face. "Estramor, I don't expect help... but I'll do anything to know of my brother's fate and to clean the stain that Arthwn has spilled on our tribe." He throws his chin back. "Anything... This, I claim."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>23</ID>
      <DefaultText>Rîdaî turns to face you, his hard features betraying no emotion, and nods. "You're right in claiming this. The anamfatha would agree to listen. There's no union between you and our tribes."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>24</ID>
      <DefaultText>Rîdaî's hard features soften in surprise. "You speak with the spirit of a Glanfathan hunter." He nods. "The anamfatha would agree to listen. There's no union between you and our tribes."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>25</ID>
      <DefaultText>Rîdaî's smirk bends the straight red stripe under his eyes. "How typical of estramorwn, to think of themselves so lofty and beyond reproach." He flares his nostrils in a deep breath. "If you're so important, discovering my brother's fate should prove a simple challenge."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />

      <ID>26</ID>
      <DefaultText>Rîdaî looks away and fumes in a restrained breath. "The ancestors will forgive me, and my brother, when I clean the shame away from his name." He looks at the huntress. "... and from the taint it has brought to our tribe." </DefaultText>

      <ID>27</ID>
      <DefaultText>Rîdaî's voice swells with pride, for a moment holding his anger at bay. "We're the Keepers of the Stone." He lets the name reverberate in the hall. "We're the first tribe. Our history runs across the ages, to the time of the Builders."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>28</ID>
      <DefaultText>Rîdaî, head lowered between hunched shoulders, glances up. Thin trails of paint bleed down from the stripe under his sorrowful eyes. "My brother... wherever he is-" The hunter clears his throat. "He'd have proudly called you friend and kin to our tribe."</DefaultText>

      <ID>29</ID>
      <DefaultText>The huntress in the group raises her calloused hand. "Still your heart, Rîdaî. Do not forget where you stand." She parts the fine strands of golden hair that float before her face and acknowledges you with a nod. "In the house of our ancestors, and the Six Tribes, we commune as one people."</DefaultText>

      <ID>30</ID>
      <DefaultText>Rîdaî stares away. The huntress looks at him and then turns to face you. "We wish you well, estramor. If you decide to commune with us again..." She glances back at the proud hunter. "Know that we would welcome your help."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>31</ID>
      <DefaultText>The elven huntress fills in the silence. "Arthwn belongs to another tribe. He is the hunter that competed against Fîorm during their blood-hunt." She gives a glancing look to Rîdaî. "Arthwn claims that Fîorm has exiled himself, deciding to not return to Twin Elms."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>32</ID>
      <DefaultText>The huntress nods. "We are one with the past, with our traditions and history. The best crafts and hunts come from our kin. Other tribes look up to our prowess."</DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>33</ID>
      <DefaultText>"They're consumed by envy." Rîdaî frowns. "That's why Arthwn lies about my brother! His tribe has no history, no glory. But now he claims it for the Twice-split Arrows while we're left to bear a false shame!"</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>34</ID>
      <DefaultText>"How do you plan to clear Fîorm's name?"</DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>35</ID>
      <DefaultText>A bead of sweat rolls down Rîdaî's forehead and hangs from his red-painted cheekbone like a drop of blood. It quivers as the hunter's muscles twitch."I can't tarry here while my brother's fate remains unknown. The anamfatha must let me go!"</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>36</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Even though Arthwn returned with the giant stelgaer's fang as proof, it's hard to believe that Fîorm would have failed to kill the prey first." The huntress digs her heel on the dark soil. "But you cannot claim that yet, Rîdaî. Not until the anamfatha judge the truth."</DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>37</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Arthwn's weak! From a lower tribe!" Rîdaî bares his teeth. "He lies! I'll find the truth and clean my brother's name."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>38</ID>
      <DefaultText>"My brother disappeared after journeying on a blood-hunt with Arthwn. That weakling hunter returned alone, claiming that Fîorm exiled himself in shame after losing to him during the hunt. Lies!"</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>39</ID>
      <DefaultText>"To judge Arthwn, and to clean our tribe's name, they cannot listen only to your truth." The huntress lowers her head, glancing at you. "Before the anamfatha, only an impartial voice can speak for what happened." </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>40</ID>
      <DefaultText>Rîdaî whips his neck, and the drop of sweat lingering on his cheekbone flies in your direction. "You mean to involve this one? An estramor?!"</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>41</ID>
      <DefaultText>She points at him, her calloused finger curved like a claw. "Listen to me now. Arthwn returned. With proof! Your brother did not even come back." The huntress blows against the fine hairs floating down over her face. "The tribes are split. Something must be done."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>42</ID>
      <DefaultText>"You mentioned a blood-hunt. What is it?"</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>43</ID>
      <DefaultText>"We prove our worth in a blood-hunt. We set out to stalk and prey, always a dangerous creature. And only one kills it first..."</DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>44</ID>
      <DefaultText>The elven huntress interrupts with an exasperated sigh. "Yes, but we hunt as pairs, to bond, as Glanfathan, as one, not as enemies. Two hunters, two tribes, one spirit. That is our way."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>45</ID>
      <DefaultText>Rîdaî glowers in response. "Our way isn't to lie! We don't betray our brothers and sisters for our own gain!"</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />

    <Entry>
      <ID>46</ID>
      <DefaultText>"The blood-hunt between your brother and Arthwn has broken the communion of our tribes, Rîdaî. Do not dig in this wound until you can claim the truth" She turns again to face you. "Perhaps our customs appear strange to you but, despite what you now see, we Glanfathans hold our bonds sacred."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>47</ID>
      <DefaultText>The huntress nods at you. "Fîorm and Arthwn went to the Northweald forest, beyond the Oldsong pass, to hunt a giant stelgaer. Search there and return to us with the truth if you can, but be aware. Stelgaer of such size, many times over their lesser kin, usually gather a big pride that follows them closely."</DefaultText>

      <ID>48</ID>
      <DefaultText>The elven huntress nods. The fine strands of gold covering her face like a veil blow lightly as she speaks. "You have washed away the stain from our name. Our history will remember your deed." She turns to face Rîdaî. "But you will have more than our memory."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He unwraps a bundle of leathers covering a long spear. Its wooden shaft reflects light as if it were polished stone. A serrated blade crowns its top with an iridescent glow. "It has always belonged among the Keepers of the Stone. Now, your hand wields it."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>50</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Thank you, friend. Walk with sure stride, that we may meet again." The group of hunters bow before walking away, their poise strengthened and their pride renewed. The weight and craftsmanship of the spear in your hand leaves no doubt - a gift fit for the best of Eir Glanfath.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Rîdaî throws his arms in the air. "Why?!" He looks at you as if the answer were obvious.</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>54</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Rîdaî, please, still your anger. He does not know our customs." The huntress turns to you and nods. "Arthwn stands much to gain from claiming a victory over Fîorm. It brings renown and glory to his kin, a lesser tribe, the Twice-split Arrows."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText>"Rîdaî, please, still your anger. She does not know our customs." The huntress turns to you and nods. "Arthwn stands much to gain from claiming a victory over Fîorm. It brings renown and glory to his kin, a lesser tribe, the Twice-split Arrows."</FemaleText>
