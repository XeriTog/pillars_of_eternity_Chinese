      <DefaultText>An old elven woman clothed in thick robes beckons you to approach. "Welcome, foreigner. Welcome!" Her forearms, splotched by green and blue stains, wiggle out of her hanging sleeves like caterpillars out of ripe fruits.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Estramor, we meet again. I expect that you've considered my offer to deal with Rinatto."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Rinatto won't trouble you any more. He left town."</DefaultText>

      <ID>24</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Dead?" Alarhî's eyebrow raises, her posture stiffens. "I am not surprised, given his behavior thus far - but the death of a Vailian merchant could bode poorly for trade."

Reaching into her robes, Alarhî produces a small pouch. "Still, the matter is settled and Rinatto will no longer darken our market. Here is your payment for services rendered. Travel safely, estramor." </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>25</ID>
      <DefaultText>Alarhî nods with a smile. "I am pleased you were able to convince Rinatto to leave on his own two legs - what trouble it would be to have him leave on a stretcher."

Alarhî takes a small pouch from her robes and presses it into your hand. "You have done well, estramor - accept this reward for your services. And should you need herbs or tinctures, I will see to it that you are always treated well at my shop."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>45</ID>
      <DefaultText>Alarhî stands tall and proud, surrounded by Glanfathan warriors that study your every move. "I expected Rinatto to employ someone on his behalf - I am surprised to see that it is you doing his bidding."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>46</ID>
      <DefaultText>She tilts her head to the side and blinks slowly. "Does the presence of my armed entourage concern you? You were expecting a defenseless shopkeeper, am I right?"

Alarhî raises her dye-stained hand just as one of her guards begins to lurch forward. "Stillness!" she barks at her attendant. "Give the estramor a chance to speak!"</DefaultText>

      <ID>47</ID>
      <DefaultText>An old elven woman stands tall and proud, surrounded by Glanfathan warriors that study your every move. "You speak on Rinatto's behalf, I presume? I knew he would convince someone to do his bidding... I did not suspect it would be the estramor involved in all the chaos at Defiance Bay."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />

      <DefaultText>"I'm here for Rinatto's money."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>49</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I want to hear your side of the story."</DefaultText>

      <ID>50</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I don't care about the Vailian. Maybe I can help you instead."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>51</ID>
      <DefaultText>The old woman smiles at you with a tilted eyebrow. "Of course... what else do the estramorwn value more than coins?"

Out of the folds of her robe she produces a small root and holds it beneath her nose, inhaling its fragrance. "The Fisher Crane tribe has courted the soil for generations. Does Rinatto believe these herbs grow like weeds? Without our efforts? Without toil?"</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>52</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Unguents, potions, tinctures!" She makes a sprawling gesture at a collection of pots, bottles and herbs that lies behind her. "If you seek it, I have it. Always."</DefaultText>

      <ID>53</ID>
      <DefaultText>"We are not Dyrwoodan beasts - here, hospitality reigns!" Alarhî nods to you, holding up an open hand, her palm and fingers covered in blue and green dye.

"Envoy of the Vailian, speak the message you were sent to deliver."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>54</ID>
      <DefaultText>Alarhî smashes the plant stalk between her palms, adding streaks of rusty orange to the blue and green dyes already soaking her hands.

"The deal has been done. Rinatto has the spoils of our harvest. We cannot reunite the Vailian with his coin anymore than we can put the Elardh Golah leaves back on the stem."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>55</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Tell Rinatto he must accept the consequences of the deal that he negotiated. If he continues to mewl false tears of indignation, we will show him how petulant children are disciplined."</DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>57</ID>
      <DefaultText>The old woman looks to her guards, then to you, and raises an eyebrow. "Already? What little patience you must have."

With a snap of her fingers, the guards stand in attention. "Cleanse this filth from my hearth!"</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>58</ID>
      <DefaultText>"The first step of any sensible path," she muses, scratching her chin.

"Rinatto did purchase from me several bushels of Elardh Golah. And for it, he paid a high price, but did so willingly - saying it was a 'bargain' right as he handed me his copper."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>59</ID>
      <DefaultText>"It was after our trade that the Vailian spit his venom!" Alarhî's voice grows angry.

"Rinatto accused me of trickery, of fraud - claiming I delivered withered likenesses of Elardh Golah and not the genuine root!"</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>60</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Such nerve! For in truth, he is beyond the help of Elardh Golah." She holds a blue-dyed finger in the air before curling it down slowly, smiling as she does. "Rinatto's old bow isn't firm enough for a full draw - no amount of Elardh Golah will give him the spear of a young hunter."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>61</ID>
      <DefaultText>"A fair deal was made, and now Rinatto objects - angry that his withered family plow is beyond herbal remedies."

She shakes her head, her voice becoming a growl. "I have never sold anyone a remedy I knew to be false! If Rinatto does not silence his slanderous tongue, we will do it for him."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>62</ID>
      <DefaultText>"What kind of punishment do you have in mind for Rinatto?"</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>63</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Rinatto has slandered his host - making him no longer a guest. The merchant must vanish from the Twin Elms." She crosses her arms under the sleeves of her robe. 
</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>64</ID>
      <DefaultText>"But Glanfathan hospitality must be observed, always. He is to be given a chance to leave on his feet before he bleeds on his back. Deliver, in our name, a warning."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>65</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Tell Rinatto that if he does not leave, he will be accused of conspiring to pilfer Engwithan relics from our lands. He won't risk a trial by the council of anamfatha."

Alarhî draws a small wooden cage from the folds of her robe. "If he won't listen, tell him that his faulty member will end in a cage, just like this black beetle. Food for our birds."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>66</ID>
      <DefaultText>She eyes you for a long moment. "You would turn on him?" She raises an eyebrow, smirking.

"Rinatto must vanish from our sacred city. He sows distrust and must be uprooted. If you wish to help, convince him to be elsewhere."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>67</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I will deliver the message."</DefaultText>

      <ID>69</ID>
      <DefaultText>"The reputation of your tribe is tied to your actions. Is that how you want future trading partners to remember your kin?"</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />

    <Entry>
      <ID>70</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Tell me again how to help you."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>71</ID>
      <DefaultText>"As a friend of Twin Elms, I ask you to return the Vailian his money, as a favor to me."</DefaultText>

      <ID>72</ID>
      <DefaultText>The Glanfathans look at each other, faces alight with disagreement. A murmur of voices rises around the dwelling's hearth until Alarhî, eyes shut tight, stomps on the ground with force. "Enough! Stillness!"</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>73</ID>
      <DefaultText>She waits until her brethren's voices die down before opening her eyes. "You speak with long-sighted judgment. Trade strengthens all of the tribes, and Rinatto's claim, false as it is, may spread to poison us."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>74</ID>
      <DefaultText>"We will suffer the indignity of letting this liar profit if it means safeguarding the peaceful, honorable accord of Twin Elms."

Alarhî pulls up one sleeve, revealing a leather bag hanging from her hand. The clinking of copper fills the room. "Take this back to the Vailian with the... blessings... of the Fisher Crane tribe."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>75</ID>
      <DefaultText>The old woman regards you for several moments, her face wavering between a frown and a smile.

"A kindness for a kindness? Not so different from trading coins for herbs - things for things. Empty gestures for one's own benefit. Yet..." She stares at her stained hands.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>76</ID>
      <DefaultText>"You've shed blood and sweat for our people." Alarhî brings her hands together, interlocking her fingers. "Empty gestures find their fill in each other, as one." She lets her hands drop and nods at you.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>77</ID>
      <DefaultText>Alarhî nods at you. "Return to me when the Vailian has disappeared from Twin Elms."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>78</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I've got what you seek. Always. Come see!" Between bows and smiles she points to a little girl beside the herbalist's store. "We're here to help you, foreigner. Yes, we are. The Fisher Crane tribe serves your people."</DefaultText>
