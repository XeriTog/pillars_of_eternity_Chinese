      <DefaultText>This man looks up sharply as you approach, eyes going wide. "You!" </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"You're the one - the one he's looking for." He sets down his wine. "You killed Lord Raedric." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"What if I did?" </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"How dare you accuse me of something so heinous!" </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Keep it down, idiot." </DefaultText>

      <ID>6</ID>
      <DefaultText>"N-no, you don't understand. It didn't work, it... I'm one of the guards at the keep. Was, was one of the guards. He's killed most of them. The ones you didn't." </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />

      <ID>7</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Kolsc, he didn't last very long. Nothing but empty air, him. Nice enough to work for, I mean. Much nicer. But that didn't help him when Raedric came back. Gods, the screaming..." </DefaultText>

      <ID>8</ID>
      <DefaultText>"We figured we had the place to ourselves a little while, after you left. Until they sent someone new. But one night we hear something in the throne room, and... and it's him. Lord Raedric." </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>9</ID>
      <DefaultText>"His eyes... it was like he was burning inside." He shudders. "He says he's come back to lead us, like before. Says he's going to kill you for what you've done." </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>10</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Weren't many of us left, after you came through. When we found the keep like it was, well, we figured we had the place to ourselves a little while. Until they sent some new noble down. But one night we hear something in the throne room, and... and it's him. Lord Raedric." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Then perhaps I should seek him out." </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />

      <ID>12</ID>
      <DefaultText>"He's going to have to wait. I've more important things to do." </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>13</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I suppose you have some kind of trap waiting for me back there?" </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>14</ID>
      <DefaultText>"You mean I have a chance to kill him again? How could I refuse?" </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>15</ID>
      <DefaultText>"And what's your stake in all this?" </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>16</ID>
      <DefaultText>"What? N-nothing. I don't mean to go back there long as I live. I figure I'll find work here in Twin Elms somewhere. Even if I have to guard some hut-dweller's goats or something." </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>17</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Until then, I plan to drink until I don't remember any of what happened. Good luck to you. There's something awful out there howling after your blood." </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>18</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Sure. You might want to leave the Dyrwood altogether, even. I would, if I were you. This place is the furthest thing I could afford to get to. Figure I'll find work here somewhere. Even if I have to guard some hut-dweller's goats or something." </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />

    <Entry>
      <ID>19</ID>
      <DefaultText>"It won't be like last time, I think. He's not human. I mean, not mortal, anymore. It's like he just up and refused to stay dead. I've never seen anything like it. Hope I never see anything like that again." </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>20</ID>
      <DefaultText>"In fact, I'm staying put here and drinking until I don't remember a thing. I wish you all the luck in the world, friend. There's something awful in that keep, howling after your blood." </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>21</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Who, me and the poor fools Raedric threw off the ramparts? I haven't got a thing to do with him, and begging your pardon but I'd rather keep as far from you as I can manage." </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>22</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Just going to sit here and drink until I don't remember a thing. I wish you all the luck in the world, friend. There's something awful in that keep, howling after your blood." </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>23</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Yes, sure. He'll love that, he will. Dying hasn't stopped him thinking himself noble, even when he's hurling poor Lendry off the wall." </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>24</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Me, I don't mean to go back there as long as I live. I figure I'll find work here in Twin Elms somewhere. Even if I have to guard some hut-dweller's goats or something." </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>25</ID>
      <DefaultText>"You keep away from me. I don't want to be around if he decides to come looking for you." </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>26</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I told him I'd find you, give you his challenge. Do it all honorable, that sort of thing. He let me go. And I kept on running far as my coin let me." He laughs bleakly. "Funny, me running into you anyhow." </DefaultText>
