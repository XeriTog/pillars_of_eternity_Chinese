      <DefaultText>"She'll pay! That witch, she'll-"

Fuming with anger and pacing in tiny circles, the Vailian merchant aims his wild rant at you as you approach.

"You there! Have you come here to trade with the savages? Learn from my example and take your business elsewhere!" Spittle accents his every sentence. "Liars! Cheats! Swindlers!"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Rinatto looks away from you, scratching his neck and shifting his feet.

"I am destitute and have but a few meager offerings left to sell - how dreadfully embarrassing. If I can recover my investment from Alarhî, I'll have funds to resupply my stores. Until then, you are welcome to take a look at what I still have in stock."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Rinatto smiles as you approach, his arms outstretched to greet you. "My friend, you have returned!"

He smacks his hands together and rubs them intently. "So... care to see my special selection?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"You again," Rinatto spits as you approach. "I was kicked out of Twin Elms on account of YOU! Now it's time to settle the score."

Rinatto puts his fingers in his mouth and whistles a high, warbling cry. Armed men appear all around him. "I hired some friends to make sure I could pay you back... properly."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"When I get my hands on-" Rinatto halts his sentence, his eyes darting about at the nearby Glanfathan guards.

"I'm in the savage's home court, so it's my word against hers - where does that leave me? I'd be a fool to threaten her here, on tribal soil."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Di verus?!" Rinatto's eyes widen as his hands greedily snatch the purse. "Belfetto! I had almost given up hope!"

Rinatto counts the coins, smiling with each clink of copper. "My thanks to you, friend. With this, I can finally restock my wares! Come find me at the Celestial sapling. I'm sure I can find some choice items for resourceful customers like yourself."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Rinatto's jaw drops, his eyes lock with yours. "You devious cad! I've done nothing of the sort!"

He folds his arms, puffing out his chest. "And just what makes you think the Glanfathans would believe your lies over my good word?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Alarhî gave me this beetle in a cage for you. She said your 'problem' would end in the same place if you continue your stay in Twin Elms."</DefaultText>

      <ID>20</ID>
      <DefaultText>Rinatto's face turns bright at the sight of the gift. "Insufferable witch! She can shove that beetle in her fetid mating hole!"

Gesticulating with every word, spit flies from Rinatto's mouth as his voice grows louder. "Her and her facepainting thugs will pay for this insult!"

He reaches out to strike the cage out from your hands...</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Oh I'm sure you will," Rinatto says with a laugh.

      <DefaultText>Rinatto shakes his head as you approach. "What now? More lies about me being a relic hunter? You can threaten to tell the Glanfathans whatever you please - they won't believe your word over mine."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"That's right, they won't-" Rinatto's sentence falters and all color drains from his face. "You... hold council with the anamfatha?"

"If you will pardon me, I have business, um... elsewhere..." Trembling with fear, Rinatto scampers under your gaze to round up his belongings. Once packed, he hurries off without a word.</DefaultText>

      <ID>26</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I... see your point." Rinatto's face turns white as snow. He lowers his head, unable to meet your gaze.

      <DefaultText>You reach out with blinding speed, catching Rinatto's hand mid-flight, stopping his blow before it strikes. He tries in vain to free himself from your grasp.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Rinatto swings at the cage but strikes your forearm instead. The trapped insect falls harmlessly on the ground. Rinatto turns to face you, his face flush with rage.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Madiccho!" The Vailian merchant shouts at the top of his lungs. "Savage filthy animals! This damned city will burn!" You hear a whistling sound from nearby. "I'll kill y-" Rinatto's voice gurgles mid-sentence.

The tip of an arrow, gleaming red, protrudes from his throat. The merchant quivers in a quick spasm, flailing his arms. He drops to his knees, spurts of blood flowing down his chest. You look up and notice a Glanfathan archer approaching the scene.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Your booming voice halts the Vailian mid-swing. He backs away from you, for a moment terrified of your presence, but quickly regains his bravado, and throws himself at you with renewed vigor.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"That duplicitous bitch Alarhî! She claimed to be selling Elardh Golah flower buds, but all I have now is six bushels of common house plants! The herbs are useless!"

He throws a handful of dried plants to the ground, stomping on the brittle stems and leaves, kicking up pungent, savory scents.

"I'll get my money back from that swindling savage."</DefaultText>

      <ID>42</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Well I..." Rinatto fidgets in place, his hands smoothing the creases in his tunic. "How can I sell a remedy I have not tested? Of course I tried the herb - imagine what would have happened if I peddled this pale imitation!"

Rinatto clears his throat, his voice grows quiet. "The herb did NOT have its intended effect. The only thing it made hard was not vomiting."</DefaultText>

      <ID>43</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Nothing of substance..." he quickly mutters. "She defended herself, of course - saying the herbs were legitimate. Why wouldn't she lie? No one will value my word over hers."

He spits on the ground. "Alarhî can lie with impunity when surrounded by her gangs of savage thugs."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>45</ID>
      <DefaultText>Rinatto's rage abates for a moment, and his face twists into a nervous smile. "Elardh Golah is a plant that grows in the jungles of Eir Glanfath."

He clears his throat, lowering his voice. "When dried and consumed or brewed into a tea, it's known to... known to uh... enhance one's drive for the better pleasures in life."</DefaultText>

      <ID>46</ID>
      <DefaultText>He sighs, pressing on his temples. "I cannot sell this worthless herb to recover my coin. And I am powerless to confront Alarhî."

"I don't suppose...," he looks at you, sizing you up, "If you were willing to mediate, perhaps you could succeed where I failed. I would, of course, pay you handsomely for your troubles."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Rinatto rubs a dried leaf between his fingers, inspecting the herb with a scowl. As you approach, he looks his eyes on you.

"You there, friend! Have you reconsidered helping me? I am without friends in this city."</DefaultText>
