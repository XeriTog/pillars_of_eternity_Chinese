      <DefaultText>"The oldest of the six tribes." He points the tip of his sword at a long hut behind him. "Up the stairs and into the Passage of the Six. This is where our anamfatha gather. Bethwl, the anamenfath of the Guided Compass, can tell you more."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"This is Hearthsong. It's a place where Glanfathans and estramorwn may gather together. It is also the site of the Passage of the Six, where our tribal leaders, the anamfatha, meet." 

He points to a large, round building at the other end of the district. "That way is the market. Guard your purse there - no one bargains like a Glanfathan. And if you need a place to stay, follow the fence to the east. There, you will find the way to the Celestial Sapling."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"It is the place where our anamfatha are laid to rest among stones placed by the Builders. They say the souls of some of the anamfatha linger there still.

"The way lies through Oldsong. It is the holiest place in all of Twin Elms."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"There is Noonfrost, which is dedicated to Rymrgand. A group of pale elves from the frozen southlands arrived not long ago to oversee it.

"There is also The Nest, a temple of Hylea, and Galawain's Maw, a den of beasts dedicated to the hunter god. The route to the Burial Isle also lies that way."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"There lies Teir Evron, one of the only towers of the Builders still in perfect condition. Two great elm trees twine around it - even the mightiest works of the gods protect the works of the Builders. Two delemgan sisters dwell there now.

"The Hall of Warriors stands at the other end of the district. Rumor has it that Anamfath Simoc of Three-Tusk Stelgaer is there now."</DefaultText>

His words trigger something in your memory. You see an image of a perfect cube of adra. Just as quickly, the image fades.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"A leader of one of the tribes could give you the permission of the city. Only Anamenfath Bethwl is present in the Passage of the Six today, and she has her own troubles." He jerks his head at a long hut in the middle of the district.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Elms' Reach is also where the druids keep their halls. There are the Ovates of the Golden Grove and the Ethik Nôl of Blood Sands. Many shudder at the brutal sacrifices of the Ethik Nôl, but High Ovate Erona is just as powerful in her own way."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"The city is sacred to all Glanfathans, as it is the place where our ancestors first encountered the Builders. That fated meeting turned our people from generations of wandering to a permanent home among the Builders' relics.

"When the Builders commanded us to settle here, they allowed us the unique privilege to live among their structures here. It is the only place in Eir Glanfath where this is permitted."</DefaultText>
