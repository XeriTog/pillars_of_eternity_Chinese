      <DefaultText>"I am the anamenfath of the Guided Compass. Like many anamfatha, I have leadership in my blood. While tribal authority is not strictly hereditary, we believe that strong leaders can impart a portion of their soul to their children and grandchildren, meaning that anamfatha may succeed from a single line for many generations."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>A middle-aged orlan woman stands at the back of the longhouse, an expression of irritation on her narrow features. As you approach, she takes a decisive step toward you.

      <DefaultText>A vision of an orlan man appears near Bethwl. He has the same green-brown fur and hazel eyes as she does. "Help me reason with them." He points behind you.

Turning, you see the ghostly shapes of five other anamfatha - another orlan with tawny fur and a scarred face, a frowning dwarf, a black-furred orlan, and two elves.

      <DefaultText>They're shaking their heads and looking at the orlan man near you with doubt only a few degrees removed from hostility.



The five skeptical anamfatha have disappeared, but the green-furred man still looks at you beseechingly.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The spectral orlan takes another step from her, setting his foot down with a slow, heavy motion. Tendrils of essence strain between them, and he grimaces and leans forward, as if struggling against a gale. 

The angry anamenfath winces.

"War." The spectral orlan's voice is a rasping croak. "They're headed for war. Remind them of Ferwlt's warning."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Ferwlt's soul-image gasps. Taut threads of essence tug at him, drawing him back into the anamenfath. He looks up at you again. "I tried to tell them. The Builders' souls have touched even the estramorwn."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She gasps as the last of Ferwlt's soul fades back into her. The tribesmen gape at you.

"There's no way you could have known this saying. Not unless..." She takes another step toward you. "You are a Gal&#373;s an Anams. A watcher of souls."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>48</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Ferwlt's warning came before the Broken Stone War. Ferwlt - my ancestor on my mother's side - was anamfath of our tribe then. When the estramorek farmers defiled the Builders' monuments, Ferwlt urged the other anamfatha to patience." 

She folds her clawed hands in front of her and gazes down at them. "But louder, angrier voices prevailed."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>49</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Ferwlt believed that the invaders could be taught to respect the Builders as we do. He also believed that the Builders' souls had spread to all peoples and that we should avoid needless conflict with others. More practically, he worried that a violent response would only spur further bloodshed across the generations."

She spreads her hands. "And you can see where we are today."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>50</ID>
      <DefaultText>She presses her mouth into a thin line. "While Ferwlt's words were shrewd, they were ignored back then. Simply remembering his warning now will not undo the wars and the changes that the years have seen. There is blood on these stones, and that is all anyone remembers now."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Another estramor came through here a few days ago and... well, letting him through was a mistake. One I am eager not to repeat." She levels her gaze at you.

      <DefaultText>Suspicion creeps back into her eyes. "I won't repeat a mistake in my haste to correct it.

"We bar Twin Elms from estramorwn to protect the ancient places that the Builders left behind. The Builders left this heritage to us to defend, but they alone had access to it."

She sighs. "On this much, at least, the six tribes agree."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You again see the polished adra cornerstone in your mind. This time, the image is clearer. Each face of the stone is inscribed with a phrase you know by heart.

      <DefaultText>An image of a polished adra cube flashes into your mind. There is writing on the sides, but the image is too faint for you to read it.

The anamenfath turns away from you and looks at the ground, gnawing a pointed claw.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She runs her hands over her ears, thinking. "Very well. The city is yours to explore. Tell the guard at the gate that you come to see the cornerstone with the blessing of the Guided Compass.

"If the gods have truly returned one of the Builders to us... find the delemgan of Teir Evron. In Elms' Reach. If the gods have sent you here with a purpose, the delemgan will know."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"In truth, there are more than six tribes, but the six largest have traditionally led the others.

"Each of the six has a seat here in the Passage of the Six, where we discuss matters of common interest. You saw, for instance, the debate that occurred before the Broken Stone War." She gives you a hesitant look.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Many of the tribes, even among the six, look to the Keepers for guidance and leadership. Their long history grants them a place of honor in our society, though it has also made them more conservative, in my observation."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"A mostly orlan tribe from the Thein Bog. Most of the sites they guard are half-buried in the wetlands, and even the other tribes couldn't tell you where they are."

She crosses her arms. "They are not the most renown of the tribes, but they are the cleverest and subtlest. Say what you will about the berserkers of Three-Tusk Stelgaer - I'd rather face them than a Fisher Crane ambush squad any day."</DefaultText>

      <ID>85</ID>
      <DefaultText>She laughs and shakes her head. "Same as everybody - they're fearless maniacs and they want everyone to know it.

"They're considered a wild bunch, even among Glanfathans. Many of their territories have seen the most conflict with the estramorwn, and they don't forget it. They don't want anyone else to, either."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"They inflicted and bore some of the heaviest casualties in the wars with the estramorwn. In fact, there was a rift within Three-Tusk Stelgaer after the War of Black Trees. Dozens of clans broke away from the ravaged lands and retreated further into the Dyrwood, joining whichever tribes would take them. 'Broken tusks,' some call them. The majority of the tribe dug into the half-burned forests to hold the line, and many respect them for it."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Mostly dwarves out of the White March. They're one of the younger tribes, formed over the years by trade routes between the wilds and the mountains. They see themselves as genuinely Glanfathan, though, and who can argue with them? Only Fisher Crane defends sites in such inhospitable territory."</DefaultText>

      <ID>88</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Personally, though, I'd say it's gone to their heads. They like to think the rest of us have it easy in the lowlands, forgetting that the wars with the estramorwn never reached their mountains. Still, they came to our aid during both. 

"They're named for a tough, thorny little plant that grows up in the mountains. It suits them."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Not many are. They're traditionally outcasts and exiles from other tribes. Probably the least-respected tribe of them all, but our ancestors believed they should have a voice, and so they've got a seat among the six."</DefaultText>

      <ID>90</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Most of the other tribes see them as scavengers and bottom feeders, but don't say that to a Twice-Split Arrow. They think themselves survivors, and they're as proud of their tribe as anyone else." She shrugs. "They'll accept anyone, and I suppose there's virtue in that.

      <DefaultText>"Indeed. We're one of the younger tribes, and not one of the most prestigious.

      <DefaultText>Bethwl stands at the head of the hall, lit from behind by dozens of candles. She casts a long shadow across the floor. 

"We've gathered to weigh the claims of Arthwn and R&#238;da&#238; in the matter of F&#238;orm's disappearance. To that end, we are honored by the presence of a Gal&#373;s an Anams, whose insight will help us render a verdict."

      <DefaultText>"We begin with Arthwn's claim. He asserts that F&#238;orm lured him into a confrontation with the stelgaer and that he slew the beast on his own. F&#238;orm, he says, exiled himself, fearing that knowledge of his actions would heap shame on the Keepers of the Stone."
