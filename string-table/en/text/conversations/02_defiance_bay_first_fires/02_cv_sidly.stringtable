      <DefaultText>The young woman wears a simple but well-tailored uniform. She watches the comings and goings around her with quiet attention.

      <DefaultText>"It's the seat of government here in Defiance Bay. This is where Duc Admeth Hadret declared freedom from Aedyran rule some one hundred fifty years ago." 

She lowers her voice and grins. "It's also a hotbed of regional politics. Trust me, the gossip here beats what you'll find in any tavern or brothel in the city."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I'm a page here at the palace. I deliver messages and run errands for the duc and his advisors. The pay's not great, but I can't think of a better introduction to politics."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She laughs. "Where to start? We've got meetings, public hearings, and ceremonies, and that's just the stuff that happens out in the open."

She leans a little closer. "This is where the duc and his key advisors work, so there's always someone bartering for a favor. Unfortunately, I'm not at liberty to talk about that side of things."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"But, if you want the official version..." She clears her throat and gestures counter-clockwise around the palace. "We have a shrine devoted to Magran, official records, and chambers for public hearings and council meetings."</DefaultText>

      <ID>17</ID>
      <DefaultText>"It's a symbol of Magran's protection of Defiance Bay. She's represented the revolutionary spirit of the Dyrwood ever since independence, and her involvement in creating the Godhammer bomb only affirmed her importance to us."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"What kinds of records are stored here?"</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>19</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Mostly dull, official stuff. Census counts, tax records, militia registers. Now, I keep my distance - I got curious one day and got drafted into reshelving half of the records."

She yawns. "Worst day of my life."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Sure is. Duc Aevar's been meeting with some of the city leaders for weeks now. Trying to figure out how to address the Legacy.

"The whole business is terribly secret, though. I tried to sit in the gallery during my lunch break one day and got turned away." She sniffs. "But a lot of the talk concerns animancy, so there's good reason they're keeping the meetings behind closed doors."</DefaultText>

      <ID>22</ID>
      <DefaultText>She looks around. "That used to be Eldrid Wenfeld. But there was an 'incident' just recently. Even I was shocked. I've seen him get into it with the politicians, but disputes like that never get violent. Not at the palace, anyway."</DefaultText>

      <ID>23</ID>
      <DefaultText>"That would be Aevar Wolf-grin. Don't let the title fool you, though. Our ducs have been elected since independence."

"Some find Duc Aevar rather coarse - he's a frontier noble. Personally, I think a rough and tumble type is just what Defiance Bay needs."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"The 'Legacy'?"</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>30</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Waidwen's Legacy. That's what a lot of people call the rash of Hollowborn. The theory goes that it's punishment for meddling in animancy."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>32</ID>
      <DefaultText>"What are Hollowborn?"</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>33</ID>
      <DefaultText>She raises an eyebrow. "You really are fresh from the road. Hollowborn are children born without souls. They often don't live for very long, and those that do have generally received some kind of treatment from the animancers."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Why's animancy so controversial?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I see."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She laughs. "Where to begin? Traditionalists think it's a crime against the gods. There's no question that poking around in souls is risky, but the more progressive elements believe it's our only shot at restoring healthy births. 

"And it doesn't help matters that animancy research often involves old Engwithan relics that were 'illegally' looted from ruins in Eir Glanfath..." She makes a quick, twitching motion with her index and middle fingers.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Ah, Dyrwood politics. It changes too quickly to be worth keeping up with. Better to strike up conversation in the taverns than try to loiter inconspicuously in the palace corridors." </DefaultText>

      <ID>49</ID>
      <DefaultText>"So what do you think about animancy?"</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>50</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Me? I think the real danger of animancy is confusing a real scholar with an expensive fake. We get a new case here every day - some poor couple in the Gift or Copperlane who spent every copper they had on a miracle cure for their unborn child. It never works."

She shakes her head. "Breaks your heart, but there's usually nothing we can do for them." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She scratches her neck. "That's also where the first of the sacred fires burn, but Fyrga, the Tranquil Ardent, has had trouble keeping them lit. Rumor has it she's looking for a successor."</DefaultText>
