      <DefaultText>He thinks carefully, then nods. "All right, then. Go on in and report to the Acolyte and she'll give you your assignment. They should be just about finished with their meeting in the big chamber."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He holds up his hands. "I haven't a clue, I assure you. We keep to ourselves and watch for uninvited guests, just like your Acolyte told us. No questions asked."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The mercenary looks at his feet. "Please, go on in." His eyes dart up to the rest of your party. "You know the Acolyte doesn't like guests. I'd keep any friends of yours out of the main chamber."

He shuffles. "She's already in a state on account of someone being late. No sense in provoking her further."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He scratches his sweaty palm. "What goes on in there ain't none of my business. My men'll leave you be, but I can't make promises about those masked kith in the back."

He grabs your proffered money and looks away. "You're on your own, all right? I didn't see you, and I don't know you."</DefaultText>
