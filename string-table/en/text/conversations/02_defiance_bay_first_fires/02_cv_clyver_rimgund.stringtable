      <DefaultText>Commander Clyver stands in front of a massive table, studying a map. His expression is set in a grim frown. "Refugees from every corner of the Dyrwood. The Dozens getting them all riled up about animancy. At this rate, we'll need twice the soldiers to patrol Defiance Bay."

He opens his mouth to say something to one of his men, but he follows the soldier's gaze over his shoulder to you. "Yes? Can I help you with something?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>For a second, he looks as if he won't say anything, but he surrenders his resolve with a sigh. 

"Fleetbreaker Castle. The High Justice has summoned almost half of my novitiates and more of my justiciars to a keep on the other side of New Heomar." Frustration flickers behind his eyes. "It's not for me to question the High Justice's orders, but it's left us short-handed. And mark me, we're just a couple sparks away from anarchy."</DefaultText>
