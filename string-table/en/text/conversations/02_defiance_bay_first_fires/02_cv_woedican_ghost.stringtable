      <DefaultText>A ghost hovers in the middle of the ruin, reciting blessings and prayers. Even as the spirit's form shifts and swirls, it retains the face of an elderly man and robes that mark wealth and status. It turns to you.

      <DefaultText>"And so you did." The ghost's misty visage contorts in a scowl. "These savage colonists may have burned it down, but worship of the Oathbinder is alive and well. These stairs lead to the main sanctum."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Lord Adwellen R&#252;gfald III, and pleased to make your acquaintance. I came to the Dyrwood on one of the first ships from Aedyr." 

His cloudy eyes swim with resentment. "And unlike the yokels and hut-dwellers around here, I still keep to the old ways."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Worshiping Woedica, the Exiled Queen and Oathbinder. I come every day to offer my devotion." 

His expression fades into confusion. "I'd love nothing more than to book passage back to Aedyr, but it is my emperor's wish that I serve in these barbaric lands. And so I do." He shrugs.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"These stairs, of course." The ghost gestures to an impassable pile of rubble. Like the rest of the ruin, it seems to have remained untouched for over a century.

"The sanctum was always belowground, adjacent to the catacombs, so it wasn't destroyed by the fires."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"There are various entrances throughout Defiance Bay, but I daresay the easiest to reach is in Copperlane. I haven't been to that part of town in ages, but as I recall, it's somewhere near the southern gate."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The ghost's hazy features sharpen with delight. "A queen among the gods. She oversees laws and oaths - everything has a rightful place, and Woedica watches over them all."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The ghost's expression churns. "Of course, not everyone accepts this. Even among the other gods, her authority is questioned. But Woedica is also goddess of memory and vengeance, and she remembers." 

Slowly, the ghost nods. "She'll remember every slight and trespass when she reclaims her throne."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He closes his eyes and massages his temples with wispy fingers. "A madhouse. That's what this town really needs."</DefaultText>
