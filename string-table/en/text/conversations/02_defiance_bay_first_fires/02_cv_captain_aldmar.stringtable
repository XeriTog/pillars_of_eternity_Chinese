      <DefaultText>Aldmar gives you an appraising eye. Judging by the scars on his face, he's lucky to be able to do that much. "Every day we get more from the hinterlands pouring into Defiance Bay. Keeps us busy on the watch, it does. You look like you're recently arrived yourself."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He glances around cautiously, then leans in towards you. He lowers his voice. "Eorn, you said? Well, what became of him?" </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>20</ID>
      <DefaultText>"He's hiding down in the catacombs under Copperlane. He should still be there." </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />

      <DefaultText>"I found him in the catacombs under Copperlane, and killed him there." </DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>22</ID>
      <DefaultText>He smiles grimly. "I see. I'll send a unit down into the catacombs to see to him." </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>23</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Well! Nicely done, then. Eorn seen to, and already buried at that. You've saved us a good deal of work." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"You've done the Crucible Knights a real service, and we won't forget that. Here. Something for your troubles." </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>25</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I had to dig through the catacombs to find him. Surely that's worth a little more?" </DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>28</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Suppose you're right. Place is crawling with foul things. Here you are." He nods sharply. "Again, you have our thanks." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"You've done the Crucible Knights a real service, tracking him down. Here. Something for your troubles." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"You have our thanks, friend." He nods sharply. "We don't forget a favor." </DefaultText>

      <ID>33</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Was that subtle? I suppose you're new, here. Eorn got his little orlan fingers in a few too many pies, if you ask me. A man of politics, and with plenty of loud friends. Better all around if this goes nice and quiet, and Eorn gets the end he deserves." </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />

      <DefaultText>"I see. Well, I'm be going." </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />

    <Entry>
      <ID>36</ID>
      <DefaultText>He eyes you calmly, and shrugs. "That's politics for you." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Tell me about the Crucible Knights."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />

    <Entry>
      <ID>49</ID>
      <DefaultText>"We're the defenders of Defiance Bay. We're not exactly a formal knighthood, but don't tell Commander Clyver I said that." He grins. "We were the first organized militia to oppose Aedyran rule, and today, we're the largest force in the city. Our soldiers undergo years of combat training, and our officers are required to have their souls read by that critter out in Dunryd Row."</DefaultText>

      <ID>51</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Looking for something? Or just knocking the dirt off your boots?"</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>53</ID>
      <DefaultText>"What's this about Dunryd Row?"</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>54</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I see."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>55</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Just a requirement of the Crucible Knights. So the higher-ups know there's nothing messy built in your soul's past." Aldmar widens his stance. "Keeping the ranks pure is fine by me, I just wish they were more careful in hiring their ciphers."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>56</ID>
      <DefaultText>"What's wrong with their ciphers?"</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>57</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Spit it out."</DefaultText>

      <ID>58</ID>
      <DefaultText>He shifts his weight and glances at the empty halls. "They're mostly orlans. I'm sure they're talented enough, but you just can't trust them. Hostility's in their nature, and they've learned to hide it over the years." He frowns and crosses his arms. "All I'm saying is they should at least be supervised by other folk. That's reasonable enough, isn't it?"</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>59</ID>
      <DefaultText>"That's a horrible thing to say!"</DefaultText>

      <ID>60</ID>
      <DefaultText>"If people treated them better, you wouldn't have to worry about them being so hostile."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Glad to see we're so well-regarded by the city's protectors." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"You're wrong." </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>63</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Sounds fair enough."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>64</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Maybe they've got the right idea."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>65</ID>
      <DefaultText>"That seems like an extreme position to take."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>66</ID>
      <DefaultText>Aldmar shrugs. "I'm just speaking the truth. Nowadays, it seems that's the biggest crime of all."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Aldmar shrugs. "I'm just speaking the truth. Nowadays, it seems that's the biggest crime of all."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>68</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Exactly. But it seems like you can hardly make a simple statement like that without someone wanting to draw steel over it."</DefaultText>

      <ID>69</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Who are you?"</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>70</ID>
      <DefaultText>"A soldier of the Crucible Knights, and proud of it. I help keep everything running at the Keep so that Commander Clyver can focus on more important matters."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>71</ID>
      <DefaultText>"What goes on in Crucible Keep?"</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>72</ID>
      <DefaultText>"This is the headquarters of the Crucible Knights, so it's where we store arms and armor as well as where many of our soldiers bunk."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>73</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Commander Clyver's in the back, making plans. As usual." He scratches a scarred cheek. "You'll find the forge at the west end of the building, along with our master smith, Dunstan. There's also a shrine to the Golem, if you're the praying type."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>93</ID>
      <DefaultText>He crosses his arms and spits. "Filthy little flea-picker. What did you want to know?"</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>94</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Do you know where he is?"</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>95</ID>
      <DefaultText>"How did he manage to kill a Knight of the Crucible?"</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>96</ID>
      <DefaultText>"That's all I wanted to know." </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>97</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Rumors say he fled to the catacombs after he murdered the Knight. As much as I'd love to string him up, I don't have anyone I can spare to go crawling in that filth to check for him."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>98</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Now there's a question. Witnesses say he was drunk and arguing with the man. If I had to guess, I'd say the sneaky bastard had a weapon on him and took the justiciar by surprise. The coward ran off before anyone knew what he'd done."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>99</ID>
      <DefaultText>He shakes his head. "Watch your step in there today. Every man and woman in there is mourning fallen comrades, and some of them are just looking for an excuse."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>100</ID>
      <DefaultText>He crosses his arms. "That filthy little..." He clears his throat and looks away. "Uh, what did you want to know?"</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>101</ID>
      <DefaultText>Aldmar regards you a moment, his expression souring. "I'll say it plain - orlans aren't suited for the work. Hostility's in their nature, and it's hard for them to overcome it."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>102</ID>
      <DefaultText>"You've done a good enough job of it, maybe, but that just means you put the effort in. Most don't." He crosses his arms. "All I'm saying is that these ciphers ought to be supervised by other kith. That's reasonable enough, isn't it?" </DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>104</ID>
      <DefaultText>"You know that well enough, I think. You can't help what you are - and neither can they." He crosses his arms. "All I'm saying is that these ciphers ought to be supervised by other folk. That's reasonable enough, isn't it?" </DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>106</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Don't give me that. It'd be better for everyone in the long run. Fewer... incidents means kith get along better." Aldmar shrugs. "I'm just speaking the truth. Nowadays, seems like that's the worst crime of all." </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>107</ID>
      <DefaultText>"No need to take offense. I'm just speaking the truth." Aldmar shrugs. "Nowadays, seems like that's the worst crime of all." </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>108</ID>
      <DefaultText>"There, see? I'd even wager some of the ciphers at Dunryd Row would agree, if someone sat them down to explain things. But it seems like you can't make a simple statement around here without someone wanting to draw steel over it." </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>109</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Right. What can I do for you?" </DefaultText>
