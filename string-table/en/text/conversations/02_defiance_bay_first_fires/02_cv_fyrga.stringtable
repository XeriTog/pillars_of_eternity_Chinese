      <DefaultText>The woman's head is bowed as her lips move in prayer. Just as you approach, you catch her glimpsing at the statue near her.

    <Entry>
      <ID>43</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Magran is the most revered goddess among us Dyrwoodans, so it's no surprise that her temple is part of the ducal palace. Her fires symbolize trials, revolutions, and the blazing of new paths, all of which are important to us."

She gestures to the statue. "This is the first of the sacred pyres. When this is lit, so are the rest around the city."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She turns it in her hands. "This is a piece of the Godhammer bomb. The very weapon that Magran herself helped us build to defeat Waidwen in the Saint's War."

      <DefaultText>Her face relaxes, and her eyes drink in the glowing thing in her hands. "So it does. It's not an answer... but it has meaning." She closes her hands around the stone and tucks it away. "I'd forgotten how important that is."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Her expression cracks in anguish. "Was it a test? Or just evidence of what Magran already knew?" She tucks the rock away. "I think I suspected... but I kept hoping for a different answer."</DefaultText>

      <ID>65</ID>
      <DefaultText>She looks sadly at the empty-handed statue. "This is the true burden of faith. Not a goddess' challenge, but her absence. Her silence. Or the answer that reveals your own hollow conviction."

She folds her hands in front of her. "It will take weeks still to appoint a suitable successor. In the meantime, I'll serve the people as best I can."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>As she looks at the statue, a flame springs from its raised hand. "One of the things I have always loved about Magran is her affinity for fire. How it grows and spreads." You feel the warmth from the fire rippling across the room.

"You've given me what I need. I'll make sure to give the people of Defiance Bay the support they need."</DefaultText>
