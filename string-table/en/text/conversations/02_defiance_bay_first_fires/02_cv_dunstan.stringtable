      <DefaultText>The dwarf bustles between a sweltering forge fire and a work table. He wipes one muscle-knotted arm across his brow. "If this is about the breastplates, I already told Clyver they won't be repaired till next week."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He turns from the forge, setting his hammer on the work table. "Eh? You need something?" Dunstan yells, as if deafened by repeated hammer blows.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Dunstan's beard is matted. A trickle of blood runs along his jawline. Despite the dents in his armor, he looks strangely invigorated. 

"Haven't had a fight like that in years. It's good to be reminded of what it means to drop the pretensions and hold a weapon."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Dunstan massages his temples, leaving soot streaks on the sides of his face. "So much for his talk of secrecy. Aye, I'm building Clyver's metal warriors. He says they're what we need to keep order in Defiance Bay, so..." He shrugs and shakes his head.</DefaultText>

      <ID>18</ID>
      <DefaultText>Dunstan gives a low whistle. "That's a fine blade, indeed." He holds one fragment in his rough hands. "Looks Aedyran. Special-made. Must've been a commission for a champion of some sort."</DefaultText>

      <ID>20</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Aye, and 'twould be a privilege to. Not often you get to lay eyes on such fine craftsmanship."

He runs a calloused finger along the edge of one of the shards. "This blade'll take some time, but I guarantee it'll be worth the wait."</DefaultText>

      <ID>28</ID>
      <DefaultText>"We were all smiths back in Hadret's day, though I'm about the only one here who still gets his hands dirty." He laughs. "We're a fearsome fighting force, though these days I think Clyver takes more pride in our parade formations."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I'm a forge master. I'm a master smith for the Crucible Knights, but the way I see it, I'm also keeping up with our old traditions. The first members of our order were smiths - nowadays, most everyone's a professional soldier."

He hefts a hammer in one hand. "I suppose it's to be expected, but I think it's important we keep up with our roots, too."</DefaultText>

      <ID>33</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Suits of armor and souls. Clyver's had me repairing and reinforcing unused armor for months now, just so we can fill them with some poor sod's essence."

He wipes his shining brow. "As long as that scholar girl's got her numbers right, infusing the armor with a soul won't be that hard. But that's not what bothers me."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"She's been working out a method to transfer the souls into the armor. Getting the process just right is critical." 

He holds up one hand. "Bind the souls too tightly and you get something like those flesh constructs at the sanitarium - barely bright enough to avoid walking into a wall." He raises his other hand. "But bind them too loosely and they'll be too self-aware for their own good. Mad killers in metal bodies."</DefaultText>

      <ID>39</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I disagree with him on near about everything, and this is no exception. These forge knights won't solve our manpower problem. He can call them what he wants, but they aren't Knights."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>40</ID>
      <DefaultText>He folds his arms and looks at the ground. "And don't get me started on the other problem. Those souls he's bought to power the forge knights? Clyver keeps telling himself that they came from willing donors, but he knows better. There's a reason you have to buy souls through less-than-legal channels. We should be clearing those scavengers off the road, not doing business with them."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"What went wrong with the forge knights?"</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>44</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Something that was bound to happen sooner or later. I tried to tell Clyver that souls can't be controlled so easily. You can put a stelgaer on a leash, but sooner or later, it'll turn on you."

He looks around the smithy. "It's a shame to see so many good soldiers killed over this. But I'm glad it happened before this folly could spread to Fleetbreaker Castle."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Dunstan scratches his beard. "That's what Clyver's been looking for anyway. If you've found it, I guess I've got to start."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>48</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I'm not, and I've made it clear to Clyver that this is a mistake. Trying to harness souls like this... it's a crime against the gods, and it's bound to earn us more trouble than it saves.

"But Clyver's given me his orders. So I've got to build these things as best I can."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He hands the shard back to you. "A sword of this caliber would've had a specially designed hilt, too. It would be a shame to graft anything else onto it, and besides, it'll balance best with all of the original pieces. You find the rest of it, and I'll forge it for you."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He beams. "Finest work I've ever done, if I may say so. It's only a shame I can't take all the credit for it."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"He thinks himself a progressive man, but he's obsessed with soul lineages and connections to the Dyrwood's heroes of old." He picks up his hammer again. "Other than Dunryd Row, who really knows about any of that, though?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The smell of mud and wet grass fills your nose as Hiravias leans in close.

"'Willing donors' - now there's a laugh. I've known plenty of idiot folk willing to donate their lives... but I've never seen despair so dire one would give up on their soul."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Wait. Clyver's told me I'm to sell you any arms or armor you might want. You won't find better anywhere in Defiance Bay, I can promise you that."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He turns to his forge, hammer in hand. "Now, time to see if that Vailian was worth all that blood and copper."

He takes a polished breastplate and goes to work.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Dunstan folds his arms as he surveys his handiwork. "I'll be damned. To be honest, even I wasn't expecting it to work this well."

He wipes the sweat from his brow. "Back to it. Clyver'll want me to finish the rest of them. And it sounded like he has a job for you, too."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The Grieving Mother's expression as she looks at Dunstan is somewhere between amusement and pity. "Both live in a past of their own imagining... what purpose does it serve when so much depends on action now?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The bottom of Dunstan's beard is singed away, and he smells of burning hair. "Even I didn't believe the Dozens would go that far. Now we know what we're up against."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Those nobles and their schemes." He points his hammer at you. "Mark my words, this was all simpler back when we were simple smiths. Now we've got thieves and assassins in our midst. Wenfeld was a good man, too."</DefaultText>
