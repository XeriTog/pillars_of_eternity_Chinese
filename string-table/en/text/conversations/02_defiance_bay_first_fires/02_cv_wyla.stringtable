      <DefaultText>The justiciar's gaze flicks over to you briefly before returning to the novitiates gathered in the training area.

"If this is about patrols, my novitiates are already stretched to their limit. Between the refugee influx and the mess at Heritage Hill, I simply don't have any units to spare."

After a pause, she looks over at you again. "I'm sorry, was there something else you need?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She lowers her voice. "What isn't wrong is the real question. A whole district of walking, flesh-eating corpses. We sealed the area two months ago, just after I lost one of my finest commanders there. And yet this is the second guard rotation to disappear.

"There are already enough rumors about the place floating around the Keep without my soldiers whispering about these... disappearances." She shakes her head. "I'd just as soon abandon the district, but if those monsters should find a way out..."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She steps back and regards you. "So you're the one my novitiates have been talking about.

"If you're offering help, I won't refuse it. Certainly not from someone of your... exploits."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She quietly looks on at the novitiates. "I can't lose any more soldiers like this. Not with refugees pouring into the city and the Dozens stirring up dissent.

"Normally, I'd say this is an internal matter, but I can't afford to mount an expedition right now. And I certainly can't afford a crisis of faith at the Crucible Keep."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Used to be one of the most prestigious districts in Defiance Bay, but a few months ago, the residents all went mad. Started eating each other... and anything else that had the bad luck to wander into the district. I've never seen anything like it."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Now, every novitiate that stands guard there - every one that comes back, anyway - talks of the stench of the grave and the groans of unspeakable horrors."

She holds up one plate-clad finger. "The why and the how are questions for the animancers. I've sealed the district in hopes of containing whatever happened there. It seems to be working. For now."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Her tired eyes grow round. "By the flame, you found her? My missing commander?"

She heaves a sigh and loses her gaze among the floor tiles. "And she was calling to the watch from beyond the grave? It doesn't make sense. But nothing in that accursed district does. 

"What happened to the soldiers under her spell?"</DefaultText>

"Thank you for your help. You've left me with as many questions as answers, but at least I know what happened to my troops. And Commander Leyra.
