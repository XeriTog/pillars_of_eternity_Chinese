      <DefaultText>Several shrouded figures are lined up across from a hooded woman. The figure at the head of the line approaches her, and the woman places her outstretched hand on the stranger's forehead.

They stand in silent communion as you look on. A few moments later, the stranger steps aside and resumes his place in the circle around the statue.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I've been waiting on your reports. Quickly, now."

The woman beckons you closer with curling fingers. She rests her open hand on your forehead, and you feel the heat from her palm through the thick material of your hood.

Her voice is so low and soft that you're not certain whether she's speaking aloud or in your head. 

"State your name and purpose."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Her voice reaches you as a whisper slithering first into one ear and then the other. "Welcome, Attendant. Tell me of your exploits."

In your mind, you see a building, magnificent with trellises and tiles and located on a pristine boulevard. The wealthy and learned stroll in and out, trading knowledge and coin.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Yet it also houses misery and madness. Somewhere within its rotten core sits a man, his hair matted but his eyes alert. He watches and waits, a prisoner by choice.

      <DefaultText>The Acolyte's vision takes you out of Defiance Bay and to a town in the wilderness with a watermill. A signpost on one of the paths reads "Dyrford." Several figures huddle together, shrouded in cloaks and hoods.

An image of ruins suddenly looms in your mind. Two skeletal effigies flank a cleft in a mountainside.

The ruins fade from your mind, and in their place is a palimpsest of a neighborhood. Run-down estates are cobbled around a cemetery and an ancient tower. Savage shapes prowl the streets, and in the tower a man hunches over a strange mechanism. You can't see him clearly, but there's something unnatural about him. </DefaultText>

The Acolyte shows you a door in the base of the tower, a seemingly impenetrable slab of stone and copper. But then she shows you the invisible split between the perfectly matched halves, and you understand how the copper veins convert a command into action. The command comes to your mind, a surprising familiarity about it.

You know how to open the door.</DefaultText>
