      <DefaultText>The young novitiate's armor is recently shined, and his hair is clean and neatly combed. It's hard to believe he's ever seen battle, or that the scarred antique breastplate he wears could possibly be his.

      <DefaultText>"We're the primary defenders of Defiance Bay. The order's founders were the first to rally for Dyrwoodan independence." He waves his hand. "Of course, that's ancient history now."

      <DefaultText>"Now, we're the most prestigious company of soldiers in the Dyrwood. It's a glorious line of work." He scrunches up his nose. "If you can forget about the barracks, that is."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>As Penhelm reels from the news, a finger jabs your side. You can smell Hiravias next to you without turning to see him.

"I say this with all due offense - you make me sick. Kill a man for his actions, make him suffer for his words... but don't punish him for the soul he didn't choose."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Penhelm's face is white. "Just talked to that little cipher, did you? One of my novitiates told me he'd seen someone in the records room."

He takes a slow step toward you, extending his hand. "Give me the affidavit. I've done nothing to you." His other hand comes to rest next to his sword.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He looks at the novitiates with him. "Which is why everyone will be shocked to hear that you assaulted a company of Crucible Knights without provocation..."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You hear Hiravias' from behind you say quietly, "Well what do you know... this Watcher has a half flagon of decency..."

As all eyes turn to him, he holds up his hands. "What? Don't mind me, I was talking to myself... too loudly, it seems."

      <DefaultText>"Osric has always held some controversial opinions. But they went overlooked for the longest time because his family has such an extensive history of service in the Crucible Knights." He frowns and crosses his arms.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>105</ID>
      <DefaultText>"He finally went too far. He had the gall to suggest that we had strayed too far from our roots, that some of our officers were beginning to resemble Aedyre nobility." He rubs a spot on his bracer with a silk handkerchief.

"He would have us all wear roughspun and fight with forge hammers. I merely reported his statements."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>107</ID>

      <DefaultText>"If the Knights obsessed over their past, they wouldn't have grown into the fighting force they are today."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>109</ID>
      <DefaultText>"That history made the Knights what they are now. You can't just cast it aside."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>110</ID>
      <DefaultText>He sputters. "People change. Organizations change. The Crucible Knights began as a militia of blacksmiths, but Dunstan's one of the only officers who can wield a hammer these days. We're professional soldiers. Isn't that who you want defending a city?

"Besides, a novitiate has no business maligning his superiors."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>111</ID>
      <DefaultText>Penhelm nods. "I quite agree. And that's why Osric has no place here."</DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>112</ID>
      <DefaultText>"We've outgrown that past." He waves a shining gauntlet. "Sometimes, you need to move on."</DefaultText>

      <ID>116</ID>
      <DefaultText>"On that we can agree."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>117</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Just what would he know about that? It's perfectly convenient for him to cast aspersions, what with his pedigree in the Knights." He folds his arms.

He blinks at you. "It's a lie, of course."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>119</ID>
      <DefaultText>"What truth? That over a century ago, I was some Aedyran who's dust in the ground now?"

His hand grips the sword pommel. "I'll ask you one more time. Give that back."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />

    <Entry>
      <ID>121</ID>

    <Entry>
      <ID>123</ID>
      <DefaultText>He grabs it from you with a trembling hand. "You have no idea what this means to me. I..." He swallows. "Thank you for seeing reason."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Now do the same for Osric. Return his family breastplate."</DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>126</ID>
      <DefaultText>He hesitates, clutching the affidavit. "I'm certainly grateful to you, but Osric earned his punishment and then sent you to take his anger out on me. Why should I do anything for him?"</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>127</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Is that his breastplate you're wearing?"</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>128</ID>
      <DefaultText>"It was." He looks down and admires it. "It became property of the Crucible Knights when he was discharged. Now, it's mine.
 
"And it's not for sale, if that's what you're wondering. Not every day you find armor that was used in the rebellion."</DefaultText>

      <ID>132</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Osric's on his own. He's the one who tried to have me ruined. Take this instead. For yourself."

He gives you a nod and leaves.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>133</ID>
      <DefaultText>He looks down at the breastplate. "I hadn't thought of it that way." He pulls it off and hands it to you. "I hope this gives him some peace. And perhaps a reason to move on."

He gives you a nod and leaves.</DefaultText>

      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>135</ID>
      <DefaultText>"And he needs to get over it. You can see where being stuck in the past has gotten him.
