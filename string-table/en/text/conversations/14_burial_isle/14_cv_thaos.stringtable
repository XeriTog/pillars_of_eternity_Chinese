      <DefaultText>Edér smiles at this. "They made cake.

      <DefaultText>At the sight of Aloth, Thaos' mouth twitches derisively. "State your name and purpose, young acolyte."</DefaultText>

      <ID>33</ID>
      <DefaultText>"No." He smiles darkly. "I've risen above them. I'll take the Leaden Key and lead in a way that you, who remained nothing more than a slave to the gods, never could."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Thaos remains smug. "A leader without insight directing an organization that does not question. Quite a vision, initiate."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Thaos turns his attention to the big aumaua. "You have devoted yourself to studying the work of my people. Why?"</DefaultText>

      <ID>36</ID>
      <DefaultText>Kana's gaze is steady as he studies Thaos in turn. "I thought your people had much to teach us. That we, too, could create great machines. Improve our ships. Make an empire as vast and impressive as yours ever was, built upon your secrets." </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>37</ID>

      <ID>38</ID>
      <DefaultText>Kana blinks. A smirk slowly spreads across his face. 

"I did. But it turns out that doesn't matter, you see. I'll bring these secrets home, and set them before a thousand eyes and ears. I don't care if it takes a hundred years. We'll figure it out." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Sagani raises her chin. "I knew my hunt would send me a long way from Massuk. It was a challenge I was glad to undertake for my village."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Thaos raises his eyebrows in mock surprise. "So it was worth it, then, to tell a dying beast of things it neither understood nor had memory of."</DefaultText>

      <ID>45</ID>
      <DefaultText>Thaos' sudden attention causes Pallegina's feathers to ruffle. "I understand your ducs bels gave you a mission."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>46</ID>
      <DefaultText>Pallegina lifts her head defiantly. "Their orders do not absolve me of my greater responsibility to the safety and well-being of the Republics."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>48</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Trying to rile up Pallegina? Bad move, my friend!" Hiravias blurts out with a chuckle. "Unless you feel like you have too many limbs... in that case, keep it up!"</DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>49</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Yet you disobeyed. Something you already have a reputation for. They will know, of course. If it had been for a worthy cause they might have forgiven you. But I don't see them pursuing animancy after seeing what it's done here. 

"They trusted you and you disappointed, as you always have, and you will again be disowned."</DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>50</ID>
      <DefaultText>"The parents scold, but the children are safe. Whether animancy research continues in the Republics or not, they will survive. For now, that's enough."</DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>51</ID>
      <DefaultText>"In any case, I wouldn't be so smug about my fate, Thaos." She takes a long step forward, a sinister smile spreading across her face. "I imagine Woedica responds to disappointment much more severely than even my ducs."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He shifts his gaze downward. "What of you, orlan? My agents tell me you are far from home - both in distance and in years. Have your friends proven a worthy distraction from the pain of ostracism?"</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>53</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Ostracism? Is that the name for the groin rash your mother gave me?" Hiravias' single eye focuses in on Thaos' neck, and the orlan's ear stump twitches.

"Don't fool yourself old man, you know nothing about me."</DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>55</ID>
      <DefaultText>Hiravias chuckles, "I serve no one, but I embrace the teaching of Wael. The Eyeless Face does not have servants, only students."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>56</ID>
      <DefaultText>"But such difficulty on the way. If you had only accepted that perhaps you were fit to serve neither god, just as you were unfit to serve your tribe, you might've saved yourself the trouble."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>57</ID>
      <DefaultText>Hiravias smiles, shaking his head. "Perhaps you're too young to understand these things, Thaos, or mayhap too simple-minded. Without difficulty along the way, one isn't much of a student to Wael."

      <DefaultText>Thaos looks over your company, each one in turn. "You are here because you are lost. The gods cannot reach everyone, I'm afraid. May you fare better in your next lives."

He directs his gaze at you.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"You think your abilities only flow in one direction. That isn't how it works, I'm afraid. Not for me. For all that you saw of my soul in the sanitarium, I saw as much of yours."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I answered your questions once. That your soul is not fit to accept the answers is of little concern to me.
