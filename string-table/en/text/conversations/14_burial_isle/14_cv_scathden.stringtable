      <DefaultText>Standing proud and still, the aumaua before you is smiling broadly, showing several crooked and missing teeth. Sporting the physique of a man in his prime, his worn and weathered face appears too old for the rest of him.

He's dressed in an assortment of stitched hides and furs assembled from a motley of animals. Dangling from his belt are a series of grizzly scalps: braided lengths of human, aedyran, dwarven, and orlan hair woven around finger bones.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He sizes you up with a grin, but his gaze quickly locks with Hiravias, and he tilts his head as he examines the orlan head to toe.

"What do they call you, little one? You smell familiar but your name is unknown to me."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>His good ear flutters as he turns to face you. "Yes?" his response is as much as question as an answer.

"He smells just like me, I mean - not as musky and virile but he has that smell of stelgaer sweat and rotting leaves. Either he's bathing in my urine, or he's got the same gift as me."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Scâthden turns to you. His pupils dilate as he stares at you, smiling.

"Estramor, look closer and you will see. I have awoken to his past while he remains ignorant."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The aumaua looks you up and down and shakes his head slowly.

"I seek another, leave me be."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Hiravias steps forward and folds his arms across his puffed up chest.

"I am Hiravias, child of the Fisher Crane, Adept of the Hawk and Ivy, wanderer of Weretha." His voice is loud and triumphant, though as soon as he's done introducing himself, he takes a step back and whispers to you, "Too formal?"</DefaultText>

      <ID>9</ID>
      <DefaultText>The man ahead of you clears his throat, a feline rumble comes from his chest and for a moment, his hair stands perfectly on end.

"Hiravias? Fitting." He holds out his right hand and flexes his fingers - long black talons sprout from under filth-encrusted fingernails. He rolls his head back and inhales deeply, sighing with a smile at some perceived scent.

"Needed to bring friends with you?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You allow your eyes to relax until your mind is attuned to the invisible hum of souls.

The aumaua projects a dizzying display of red, gold, and orange - autumn halos surround his massive form.

Where his feet touch the ground, you see a network of roots and veins that trail from his feet and sink deep into the earth.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>12</ID>
      <DefaultText>Turning to Hiravias, you see glowing roots emerge from his feet - appearing as mirror images to the tendrils radiating from Scâthden. These roots of soul energy meet between the two men, and then snake deep into the earth in one twisted root.

You sense that these men have distinct souls, but only one shared past - the two men are a splayed fork in an otherwise unbroken line.</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>17</ID>
      <DefaultText>"A shared past?" Scâthden scratches a patch of fur on his cheek. "An inelegant analogy. Who I was in my last life was... diminished in my cycle of rebirth - squandered so that this runt could have life."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>18</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Runt?!" Hiravias' brow furrows and he clenches his fist so tightly you hear a cacophony of crackling finger joints. "And it's not YOUR soul it's... well it's not exactly..." His anger falters as he stumbles over his thoughts.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>19</ID>
      <DefaultText>His voice is low as he mutters back to you. "Like the tablet in the Blood Sands said about the splitting of souls... I hope this means I'm not the 'lesser shard' destined to be sacrificed." His eye widens with concern, his face turns pale.</DefaultText>

      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>24</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I am called Scâthden, formerly of the Ethik Nôl of Blood Sands. I am the Seeker's Justice, and the Hound's Hunger. I am what your friend could not be."</DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>25</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Visited? Tested. Forged - that would be the way to view it."

Scâthden looks at Hiravias with a sneer. "I previously thought it was a mark of distinction but... apparently even a half-height-half-man can manage the task. Takes away some of the glory, does it not?"</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>26</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Half-man?!" Hiravias glares back, his good eye twitching and his fur standing on end.

"That's some really tough talk coming from a man about to choke on his own blood."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>27</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Same as he wants from me, no doubt - completion." He exhales slowly, eying Hiravias as his nostrils flare. "Galawain gifted us both with the stripes of a true predator. It is our purpose to erase the weak, ensuring only the strong proliferate."

He mashes his fists together with a meaty thud. "We must honor our god-" he looks at Hiravias' eye patch and shakes his head. "MY god by doing as the Hound demands. Let us determine who bears the right to be Galawain's harbinger."</DefaultText>

      <ID>33</ID>
      <DefaultText>Hiravias growls, his fur bristles and for a moment shines with luminescent tendrils of yellow and orange.

"I asked to be a hunter - a regular hunter that gets invited to chase down dinner and eat its neck... I didn't ask for this!"</DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>36</ID>
      <DefaultText>Hiravias chuckles. "A fair criticism." He runs his hand along the band of his eye patch, his finger stopping to trace the silver embroidery of Wael that rests over his ruined eye.

After a silent moment, his posture snaps to attention and a smile comes over his face. "Well I'm glad we came." His tone is surprisingly upbeat.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />

    <Entry>
      <ID>37</ID>
      <DefaultText>Hiravias stares at you for a very long second before muttering to himself. "Yes yes... how astute of you. Wael has shown me what I need to see."

His hand darts about his tunic and retrieves his rusted iron hound amulet from the recesses of his pockets.</DefaultText>

      <ID>38</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I suppose you are right," his face turns red at your comment and he looks down at his feet. "I lacked strength and I asked Galawain for help... and the lesson he taught: Don't ask - Take!"

      <ID>39</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I uh..." Hiravias looks at you, his jaw agape. "No it's not that, it's just that I didn't realize the price. Being a hunter was a means to acceptance and..."

"And that's just it - I wanted the acceptance more than the thrill of the hunt. In my heart I'm a questioner, not a seeker."</DefaultText>

      <ID>40</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I was mad at Galawain, I should have been mad at myself. I was gifted with power - great power - and I simply squandered my energy resenting the cost of that gift. Losing contact with my tribe was the price I had to pay for demanding power."

He runs his thumb across the embossed metal icon of Galawain, his nail scraping aside a decade of rust and muck.</DefaultText>

      <ID>41</ID>
      <DefaultText>"My Watcher friend," his voice is low, almost rumbling, "I need to settle this matter."

And with that, he leaps toward Scâthden.</DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>43</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Galawain gave me a gift, my tribe doesn't agree with it - what's done is done."

He looks at Scâthden and scratches his chin. "And if erasing this soul cousin of mine is what I must do to be greater... well I guess that's not any kind of greatness I'm seeking."

      <DefaultText>Scâthden scowls, his gaze focused on Hiravias. "And you think you can just walk away from me?"</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>48</ID>
      <DefaultText>Scâthden studies his opposition and slumps his shoulders.

"I would face the Autumn Stelgaer alone, as Galawain intended it... but if his heart is not in the battle, neither is there glory for the victor."

He spits a bilious wad of phlegm on the ground. "Scamper away if you need to run home and find your genitals. I will be waiting."

Scâthden turns away from you.</DefaultText>

      <ID>49</ID>
      <DefaultText>Scâthden's eyes flare with anger as he meets your gaze.

      <ID>54</ID>
      <DefaultText>Moments later, Hiravias appears to calm down. "Thanks," he mutters with a reluctant huff. As he takes a few more strides away from Scâthden, his smile returns.

      <DefaultText>You grab Hiravias mid-insult, silencing him as you move away from Scâthden.

"Run along now. Run along." Scâthden's face contorts into a wry smile. "And don't come back."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Wael has shown me all I need to see. My ostracism is the price I have to pay for asking The Seeker for something I was not ready to bear."

He taps the Eye of Wael embroidery on his eye patch. "I am a questioner first, a hunter second - praise be to Wael, he knew I needed to learn that fact the hard way... and I prefer any god willing to give me a vague nudge instead of a 'helpful' mutilation."

"Come, let's leave this place."</DefaultText>
