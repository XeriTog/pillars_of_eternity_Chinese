      <DefaultText>Iovara sees something in your expression and shifts tone. "I ask these things not to trouble you, but to show why they must be confronted. No answer is simple, but somewhere between them all lies a truth so beautiful not even a god could conceive it.

      <DefaultText>"I've been alone here with my thoughts for so long now. I've found peace with my failures and with my punishment. I no longer curse fate for what might have been. But there is one thing that has clawed and scraped at my mind all these years. One thing that will not be put to rest until I know. Until I understand."

      <DefaultText>Iovara looks downward, her eyes glassy. "I never wanted that. I had hoped that what I taught would replace your beliefs with something that made you stronger. For many, it did. But not all, it seems." She shakes her head slowly, absently, in search of an answer that never comes.

      <DefaultText>"There is nothing to forgive. The fault was always mine. I led you down the path that led to Thaos. When I tried to steer you back it was too late.

      <DefaultText>"In a manner of speaking. This is Breith Eaman, the Court of the Penitents. Souls are confined here until they repent. They must beg the forgiveness of a god, pledge their soul to them, and they will be lifted from this place to the world above.

      <DefaultText>"That's why he's always favored Woedica. It isn't her love of promises or justice. It's her disregard for the rules. Her willingness to do what is necessary. To Thaos, she is not a deity, but an ally with which to conspire.

      <DefaultText>"If Thaos succeeds, there will be a shift in the balance of power among the gods. Woedica was vanquished once when the other gods decided she had gone too far, and her power diminished.

      <DefaultText>Beneath you, you perceive an immense concentration of Adra, deep as the world itself, vivid and humming in your awareness, a channel that passes beyond Breith Eaman and into the unbounded space beyond.

You focus on Iovara, wrapping wisps of your essence around her like some smothering, bestial claw.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Now firmly in your grasp, you drag her soul downward, even as she tears at her surroundings, trying to grab hold of anything that would allow her to resist the force you impose upon her.

You draw her deep beneath the floor, toward the magnetic pull of the arterial adra beneath, until the pull is irresistible. Then, all at once, you release her soul and she is gone.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You extend beyond the reaches of your body, plunging some part of yourself into the cold adra as though diving into a twilit ocean for some drowning swimmer.

      <DefaultText>In your mind's eye, Iovara's soul becomes a doll of parchment. Your focus flies toward the doll in waves of sparks that gather in clusters at its feet. 

You push harder, and the sparks engorge, dancing upward as flames that climb the base of the doll, curling it, peeling back the woven fibers and turning them a luminescent orange before fading them to purest black.</DefaultText>
