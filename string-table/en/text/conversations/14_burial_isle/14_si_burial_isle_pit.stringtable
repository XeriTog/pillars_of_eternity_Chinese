      <DefaultText>A great pit lies in the shadow of the statue of Woedica. No light from the surface reaches the bottom, but even so, you catch flickers of a ghostly glow in the depths. 

A wind from the pit buffets you. It isn't cold, but it raises goose flesh along your arms. The wind carries a whisper, low and sibilant.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Pallegina falls with you for a moment, but seems oddly buoyant during her slow descent, feathers fluttering silently along her arms and the sides of her face. Suddenly, her golden eyes grow wide and she shouts out, "Look out, [Player Name], the wall!"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Nearby, Kana drifts downward at a rapid pace, carried by another glowing stream of souls. 

"Ahh-! Why did I ever agree to this?!" Kana flails outwards briefly, then steadies, holding his arms out for balance. "It is hard to keep - [Player Name]! Look out - the wall!" </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You tuck your arms and legs into your torso and prepare yourself for impact. You strike the hard surface, and pain lances through your shoulder.

Fortunately, the impact knocks you back to the center of the pit, and the souls around your body adjust to keep you there.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You manage to spread your arms and legs into an 'X,' steadying your position and the rate of your descent. You start to feel more comfortable until you notice that [SkillCheck 0] is still falling too fast.

[SkillCheck 0] plummets, flailing and out of control. You could attempt a rescue, but the ground is approaching fast. It will take a feat of speed and agility to avoid injury.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Concentrating, you focus on the essence around you and knit it together in your mind. What was a jumble of souls becomes a single entity, coordinated and purposeful. It steers you to safety at the center of the pit.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You are too close to the bottom now and can only look on as [SkillCheck 0] tumbles, fighting to regain balance. You hear a pop and a cry of pain below. When you safely reach the bottom, you see [SkillCheck 0] bent over a knee.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The ground is rising fast, and you're not quite fast enough. You snatch [SkillCheck 0] out of freefall, but you're unable to regain control over your own momentum in time.

      <DefaultText>Your soul reaches toward the turbulent essence surrounding [SkillCheck 0]. Through the incredible force of your will, you are able to organize and bolster the lost souls enough to slow your companion's fall. [SkillCheck 0] reaches the bottom with a gentle thump.

      <DefaultText>You quickly descend into darkness. You reach terminal velocity in a matter of seconds, and the only way you know you are falling is by the wind rushing past your ears. Your salvation will come soon, you hope.

Even as you wonder about the capriciousness of gods and lost souls, your arm smashes against something - the wall of the pit, it seems. The pain is incredible, but you're distracted from the sting by the sudden disorientation. You're spinning, and your insides roil inside of you. 

Finally, you begin to see something in flashes. A faint light. A wide circle. Chiseled stone.

You hit the bottom, and your final vision of a speck of sky goes suddenly dark.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The sudden drop takes your breath away, but the souls catch you, encasing you in a shining, thrumming aura. But while they slow your descent, you can still feel that you are falling faster than you should.

The essence flowing around you is strong but chaotic. You find yourself drifting toward the wall. </DefaultText>
