      <DefaultText>A column of adra rises above you, stoic and silent, its ridged layers a measuring stick for the passing of ages. It feels to you as a thick block of ice, and you perceive buried deep in its core a dim, flickering flame, all but extinguished, yet preserved against the ravages of the elements.

At your approach, the flame seems to steady and draw strength, and the layers separating it from you melt away, and you are bathed in its glow, a bright beacon in the gloom.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The glow seems to fade, as though you had adjusted to its intensity, and where it was, Iovara seeps into existence, an eidolic shade hovering above the moist prison floor.

Though ageless, she appears somehow different to you now - a slight stoop to her carriage, perhaps, or a trace of sunkenness in her eyes. There is a broad scar across her face, fibrous and wormy where flames once lapped, unhealed even in death.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"What I taught was that the gods whose faith we had been spreading were not gods at all, but something else entirely. Something created by people."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I never thought of it as a faith, but I think you are right to call it that.

    <Entry>
      <ID>42</ID>
      <DefaultText>"They were conceived by Engwith, a society of high minds and broad concerns. Thaos' people. 

"In their time, every people worshiped its own gods. Sometimes they warred over it. After a few wars of their own, the Engwithans sought an end to it. They devoted all their energy to finding the true Creators."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>43</ID>
      <DefaultText>"It shook them, this finding. If they could discover this on their own, how long until others would? How long before war and chaos reigned over a world without consequence?

"But they had mastered many things in their pursuit of these answers. And with their mastery they crafted their own gods to fill the void, and sent missionaries to the corners of the world to spread their faith."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>44</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I became a missionary because the gods brought me hope that I wanted to bring to others. For a time, the truth sent me to a dark place. Then the day came when I realized nothing had changed. That I still had a purpose and the purpose was the same and it was worth living for.

"I began questioning the other missionaries in public. Exposing their parlor tricks. In time their following became mine."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>45</ID>
      <DefaultText>"The Engwithan missionaries all knew it, but they never told the rest of us. They meant it to be a secret that died with them, and in the end they allowed their bloodlines to fade from memory.

"I had been assigned to join a few of them at a temple. I found the door to their chambers closed, but the room was stone and the door thin. Their voices carried. I heard... enough. I investigated the things they spoke of, and everything was there, just as they said it'd be."</DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>46</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Later on after I left the order, a few Engwithans found my words persuasive and joined my cause. They revealed what I did not already know."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>47</ID>
      <DefaultText>"You asked me this once before. Nothing I can say would be any proof, and it may be certainty your soul craves. Resolution. But if you are bound for the same place Thaos directs these souls, you will see for yourself, as you once did."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"The woman lies. She is merely a fanatic of another kind. She may question scripture and doctrine and things open to interpretation, but there is no denying the truth of the flame."</DefaultText>

      <ID>72</ID>
      <DefaultText>The question hangs in the Grieving Mother's mind, a dim and uncertain thing. "We are all as children... orphaned and alone. Where, then, do we turn for guidance? For protection?"</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>73</ID>
      <DefaultText>"If she's right, and the gods aren't real..." Hiravias drifts off mid-sentence, a pained look in his face. "What have we been worshiping all this time?"

His face turns smug and he spits a wad of phlegm on the ground. "She's right about one thing: there's never a better substitute than seeing something with your own eyes."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>74</ID>
      <DefaultText>"...So even the gods are an Engwithan lie. Was Engwith peopled entirely by tricksters and liars?" </DefaultText>

      <ID>76</ID>

    <Entry>
      <ID>84</ID>
      <DefaultText>Durance's mouth puckers, his face livid. "Magran set a path for me. She is fickle and cruel, but that is how she teaches. You know nothing of the fires that have shaped me."</DefaultText>

      <ID>90</ID>
      <DefaultText>Aloth folds his hands behind his back, furrowing his brow. "Well, as poorly as I've chosen my guides, I suppose it would be a comfort to know that I'm free of them."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>91</ID>
      <DefaultText>She looks up at Kana Rua. "If all our common threads are spun from a lie, what's left to bind us together?"</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>92</ID>
      <DefaultText>Kana frowns. "For thousands of years, the Engwithan lie clouded our sight. How can we claim there is no other way, when we never had the opportunity to discover one? There are answers out there still, in places we've never thought to look." </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />

    <Entry>
      <ID>93</ID>
      <DefaultText>Her gaze shifts to Sagani. "What if our burdens come to us not because they are meant to be, but because they happen to be?"</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>94</ID>
      <DefaultText>Sagani shrugs. "They shape us all the same. It doesn't matter how I drew the small tooth or even that Persoq had become a deer. The task fell to me, and I completed it."</DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>95</ID>
      <DefaultText>She considers Pallegina. "What if even mastery over all things cannot answer the most basic of questions?"</DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>96</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I stopped asking those questions long ago. It is enough to care for those we love with the time we have in this life."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>97</ID>
      <DefaultText>She faces the Grieving Mother directly, seeming to see her as she does everyone else. "What if the cycle of birth and death is nothing more than a tool of endless preoccupation?"</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>98</ID>
      <DefaultText>The Grieving Mother returns Iovara's gaze, nodding her head almost imperceptibly. For a moment, all is silent.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>99</ID>
      <DefaultText>Iovara nods back, seemingly moved by some unspoken understanding.</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>100</ID>
      <DefaultText>She regards Hiravias, and his ears twitch as her eyes fall upon him. "What if neither guide knew the way? How then would you choose a course?"</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>101</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Well..." Hiravias folds his arms and tucks his hand under his chin.

"I suppose...," Hiravias replies a moment later with a smile, "I would always choose that which makes me stronger... but instead of doing it because Galawain wishes it, I'd do it merely because I wish it for my own life."

Hiravias beams a broad smile and suddenly blushes. Quickly bowing his head, you hear him mutter softly: "Oh Galawain, know that your humble servant was speaking rhetorically."</DefaultText>

      <ID>103</ID>
      <DefaultText>"And what if the fires themselves were lies? Lies you told yourself to bridge the gap between experience and truth?"

Beads of sweat coalesce on Durance's forehead and trickle down the sides of his face in streaming rivulets, as though he were a block of ice standing before a great pyre.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Spoken like a true hunter, my friend." Hiravias slaps your side and gives you a toothy grin.

"Galawain's lesson is that we are each responsible for our own strength. And if the gods aren't real, then it is doubly true that we can depend only on ourselves."</DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>121</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Well said," Hiravias says with a nod.

"Just think of this whole conversation we're having... whether or not the gods are real, simply asking the question forces us to look closely at what we know. Even if we can't answer with certainty if they are real or not, the exploration is what makes us grow."</DefaultText>
