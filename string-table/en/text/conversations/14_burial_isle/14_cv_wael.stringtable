      <DefaultText>The shadows in the cavern suddenly lengthen and swallow you. When your eyes adjust to the darkness, you find yourself in the midst of what must be another vision.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Can it...? It has to be!" Hiravias squeals with delight. "Wael!" he chirps, "But I never thought he'd reveal himself in person!"

Hiravias' face turns flush and his good eye widens with delight. "This is incredible! Even his form is fickle and unknowable... amazing..." His jaw drops open and his words become slurred, whispered ramblings.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Can it be? I never thought I'd see... with my very own eyes!" Hiravias turns pale as he examines the shifting presence.

"Even when you look Wael in the face, you can't know for certain." He bows his head to the figure.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"He Who Sees and Is Not Seen... save when he chooses, it seems." Kana regards the figure with wary fascination. "I thought the god of mysteries my chief enemy, at times, but... one cannot seek out answers if the questions aren't there." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The figure transforms from male to female, from orlan to aumaua, its bones lengthening and its fur receding into its flesh. The only detail that remains constant is the smooth, eyeless face.

The whizzing, rushing shapes from the mist converge on the figure, and as they form a spinning cloud, you realize that they are eyes.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"A mightier quarry for a more glorious battle. Yet the hunter takes the rack of antlers and the string of fangs for the memory of hunting the beast, tracking it through the wilds and grappling with it at last."

Wael folds its hands, grinning at you with an orlan's needle-sharp teeth. "Even the gods require fresh mysteries."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"And yet fresh snowfall covers tracks, and waves wipe footprints from the sand, changing the terrain. This is the landscape of new journeys and uncharted discoveries."

      <DefaultText>"A song the world knows and tires of. A droning chorus repeated again and again. Better the improvised melody, the unfolding chant. The listeners sit rapt, and just when they think they have the tune, it changes again."

      <DefaultText>"To live out countless lives, each old existence lost to the new. The point is never the end with that last, shuddering breath, but all the years that lead up to it."

      <DefaultText>The clouds break, and the torrent of rain washes Wael's features clean. His blank face molds itself again, taking on the shape of something you've never seen before. 

"Do not consign the souls to the fate of some god's choosing. You have found them - now scatter them across existence, their destination known to neither god nor mortal. Let them be lost again, new answers to new riddles."

Behind him, the sudden downpour has carved new caves into the canyon.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The shifting face laughs. "That is a word for endings, and this is but a crossroads. Even I do not know what you would choose." Shadows from the new caves melt and spread across the landscape, covering you in darkness.

When the light returns, the vision is gone.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Wael giggles, a strangely modulated sound that rises and falls as the god shifts from one form to the next. "You seek and search while your foe obscures... and even your quest for answers to your past has only led you to another mystery, and one grander still."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Changing from elf to folk, Wael raises its darkening hands to the swarm of eyes. "A nebula of souls, blind and brimming with potential. The answer to Woedica's question and the beginning of yours - what would you do with them?"

Thunder clouds form overhead, casting shadows of movement across the canyon.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You are surrounded by mists. The ground feel springy under your feet - you imagine that, as soon as you take a step, the soil behind you will erase all trace of your passage.

As if on cue, the mists before you clear just enough for you to take a couple steps forward. You do, and the fog closes behind you. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Something whizzes past you. Just as you turn, you catch another whir of movement. Out of the mist flits a shape, small and round. You think you see another. And another. They tickle the corners of your vision.

You turn back to the canyon wall. The sun shifts along its path, and what looked like a smooth rock face is the hollow of a cave. A figure steps out, its features shifting and changing before your eyes.</DefaultText>
