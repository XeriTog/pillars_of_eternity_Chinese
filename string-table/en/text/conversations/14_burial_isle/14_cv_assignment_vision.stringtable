      <DefaultText>"You have stayed true to our cause, Inquisitor, when so many others have not. For every heretic we confess, for every betrayer that burns on our pyres, new sheep continue to flock to Iovara ix Ensios. But not you. I underestimated you in the beginning, but no longer."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Not in Creitum, surely. Their lord has embraced her heathen faith and protects her with his army. But in Ossionus, things would be different. 

"The king of Ossionus is a sinful man. We have helped him to see the error of his ways, and now he fears for his soul. He would pay any price for absolution."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"You told me once that you had never met Iovara. Now you will tell me the truth."

Thaos stares into your eyes. He seems never to blink. A rush of panic spreads through your body and you can feel the sweat beginning to seep through your skin.</DefaultText>
