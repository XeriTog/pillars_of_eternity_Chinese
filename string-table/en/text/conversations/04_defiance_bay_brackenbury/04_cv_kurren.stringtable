      <DefaultText>Kurren's ears lie flat against his head when he sees you. "Not the Reymont girl. Crazy enough and missing her ring, yes, but she hadn't stepped out of her house in weeks." He wrinkles his nose. "Hangs about her like a stench."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"One case or three, depending on how you look at it." He taps his clawed fingers together. "Three weeks and a disappearance at the end of each. Some might call it coincidence. I call it a clue.

"Lady Webb knows you. Trusts you. So I shall trust you, too, so long as our interests are aligned."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>15</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Perhaps you have time to help?" He rubs his hands together. "It troubles me to think a trail such as this might go cold. Not many I can turn to outside of Dunryd Row, but you are a trusted ally."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>16</ID>
      <DefaultText>"So many secrets and trails in this city. You have to but turn a corner to find a fresh trace of something stolen. Or someone missing." He flicks an ear. "Unfortunately, we haven't the time to investigate them all.

"I am supposed to be working on other matters, but my mind still lingers on a few recent cases. Curse of a cipher, to be ruled by the whims of curiosity."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He pins his ears back. "A matter of priorities, says Lady Webb. Many problems in Defiance Bay these days, problems with more than a few missing persons at stake."</DefaultText>

      <ID>22</ID>
      <DefaultText>He grins, razor-tipped teeth showing between his lips. "Copperlane, Ondra's Gift, and Brackenbury, of course. To talk to the ones who reported the disappearances. The only ones who know enough to care. Lora, Oly, and Elcga."</DefaultText>

      <ID>26</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Best to ask Oly. Seems they drank together at the Salty Mast in Ondra's Gift. Also seems that no one else knew him well enough to miss him." One of his ears twitches.</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>27</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Not yet. No obvious connection between the victims, which is what makes me wonder so." He runs his hand along the length of one ear. "Could be animancy-related. Researchers always need subjects. The less scrupulous types, in particular." He pauses, deep in concentration. "Seems too risky for the sanitarium, but one never knows."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>28</ID>
      <DefaultText>He waves a hand. "Talk first to the people who reported our victims missing. Mayhap you will catch something I missed."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Kurren takes the ring and examines it closely. "That's hers, indeed. And it's been..." He closes his eyes. "Dark places. Cold places. Dead places." His eyes snap open. "Excellent work. With this lead, I can bring her in for questioning and get the full story."</DefaultText>

    </Entry>

      <DefaultText>He holds the page but seems to stare through the words, as if at something woven in the fabric of the paper. 

Kurren bares his pointed teeth. "I remember Penhelm. A preening peacock of a man, his mouth dry and hands moist when I told him he was a soul descendant of an Aedyran general. One who'd fought against Hadret's Rebellion."</DefaultText>
