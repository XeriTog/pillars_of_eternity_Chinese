      <DefaultText>Lord Reymont holds a shipping manifest in his well-manicured hands. Despite his expensive clothes, he has the sallow complexion and restless air of a man who devotes all of his days and most of his nights to work. "If you have business to discuss, make an appointment with my attendant. I don't have time for unexpected visitors."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He lowers his papers and looks at you for the first time. "Is that so? Let me see that." He scans the parchment with the speed of an expert clerk. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He snaps the pages in his hands. "I am lord of this house and not prone to idle chatter. If you have no business here, I suggest you be off." He doesn't look up from his papers.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He affects a strained smile. "Perhaps another time, friend. I've got a thousand bushels of Vailian durum wheat missing and hundreds of records to search. Good day."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>When he returns his attention to you, his tone is brisk and businesslike. "You've done this house - and this city - a great service. I'm certain you will consider this an adequate reward for your labors."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He frowns, his eyes still glued to the papers. "I have little patience for uninvited guests, particularly when I've just been robbed by one. Please, show yourself out."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Lord Reymont pinches crisp, sharp creases into the note. "Eliminate the competition."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I suspect it means 'Abrecan Doemenel,' the scion of House Doemenel." A look of disgust crosses his face. "A pampered, pandered lad if ever there was one."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"They were once an eminent and admired house. Now, they're just a den of thieves.

"Back in the Dyrwood's colonial days, the Doemenels were respected members of the ducal court. Which is why it was so surprising that they remained loyal to Aedyr during Hadret's Rebellion."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"When Hadret and the Dyrwood won independence, the Doemenels lost their favor but not their wealth. Rather than return to Aedyr, like other loyalist houses, they dug their heels in here and turned from politics to commerce."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He shrugs. "In one way of looking at it, they simply partnered with the wrong side. Not that they haven't prospered since, in their own way."

He rubs his jaw. "Lately, they've been seeking to carve out a new niche for themselves. One right between the Crucible Knights and the Dozens, it seems."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The corners of his mouth curl into a wry smile. "Still, far be it from me to sour a fruitful relationship." Lord Reymont produces another purse. "Now, I trust that will be all."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"The Heart of White March is a nearly flawless diamond. It's also the patrimony of the dwarves of White March. It was seized by an Aedyran lord in the early days of colonization, and the dwarves haven't forgotten it. Now, the Knights and the Dozens are both bidding for it to make a peace offering to the dwarves."

He shrugs. "Whichever party buys it, the dwarves will make useful allies for Defiance Bay. Especially these days."</DefaultText>
