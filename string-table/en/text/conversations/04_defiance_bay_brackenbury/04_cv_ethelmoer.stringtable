      <DefaultText>A well-maintained statue of a middle-aged man presides over the room, looking down unblinking over the bustle of harried academics pestered by the hopeful desperate.

A strong warmth emanates from it that you could sense from across the room. There is a human soul stored beneath the stonework. You feel its attention turn towards you.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Ethelmoer groans and the stone around him shudders. "I could have done without hearing that today.

"Many have their intrusions been into our affairs. Of course, one can seldom be certain whether they've meddled or whether calamity has struck on its own. But a few of their less skilled infiltrators have been exposed from time to time. They are a perpetual nuisance."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He groans in disgust. "Such a waste. There was none more gifted working here. In time I had hoped to rehabilitate his image. But a mind like his, so full of ideas, leaves little room for patience.

"I would inquire more into the matter but in truth you have done this institution a favor. Were his transgressions ever to reach the public, there would be a terrible uproar. I was blind to have trusted him a second time."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"It has been some time since a Watcher graced these halls." His voice echoes deeply, rumbling the floor beneath you. "I am envious of your natural insights, traveler. I can only imagine how it might have helped my work in life.

      <DefaultText>"A history lesson? This is a rare pleasure. Most come in here only concerned with cheating death in one way or another.

"We are an old institution as Dyrwood goes. This is our 94th year. As with many cities, the growth of Defiance Bay brought with it a host of problems. One of the worst was that those born with, shall we say, ill-favored souls came to populate its streets in droves. Thus, the sanitarium."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"In the statue, you mean? Well." He laughs. "I was old! And it seemed wrong to me... a lifetime spent in pursuit of discovery, only to lose it all in death. Somewhere, someday I would wake up in a new body none the wiser, and pursue a different course entirely. All that experience wasted.

"If we are ever to unearth the principles behind our existence, it will be in spite of our condition. Of that I am quite sure."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"He'll be in his office or in the patient wards. I am granting you immediate access so you can find him. No doubt you will wish to speak to him further on this matter. And I for one am curious as to what he might have to say. 

"Tread carefully in the wards. There are a few dangerous cases. I would ask also that you do your best not to agitate the patients. They have enough troubles as it is."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You finish your explanation, and Ethelmoer breaks his silence. "I have read... accounts... of people in history who could do what you describe. The accounts are few and brief and never reliable. Some go as far as to suggest that they are all the same person. 

"If truly such a person was here among us, plotting our ruin... Would that I had a body again and could be of some real use in our time of need. I fear what the future may hold for this place."</DefaultText>

      <ID>50</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Once again, I am reminded of how envious I am of your gifts. I suspect they would be of some use in verifying one's identity.

      <ID>57</ID>
      <DefaultText>"If you have been able to discern WHAT precisely they DO stand for, I would be fascinated to hear it. Just another collection of cowards trying to hold back the tide because it frightens them, it seems to me."</DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>63</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Very well. In that case, I would recommend you speak first with our resident animancers. They have frequent interactions with both patients and colleagues. You'll find them up here or in their offices downstairs.

      <DefaultText>"To live on as part of something I helped build seemed to me a better legacy than what nature had in store.

      <ID>69</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I do miss being able to take an active role in the scholarly efforts here. Now and again one of our animancers will humor me and consult over some problem, but they are a jealous breed and are too often afraid to collaborate.

      <DefaultText>"Brackenbury was a natural fit. It was growing but there was also a lot of money here back then. This place owes its survival to the curiosities of the wealthy more than anything, I think.

"Our founding came at a time of great suspicion in animancy, much like today. So much progress has been lost to the mishaps of a few careless practitioners."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />

    <Entry>
      <ID>71</ID>
      <DefaultText>"But in time it was forgotten as all things are. Since then we have been at the forefront of animancy's resurgence. We have played host to many gifted researchers and pushed the boundaries of our knowledge in ways never thought possible.

"Some of the first safe transferences were done here, and we have pioneered work in soul purification, lineage analysis, preservation... it's really quite a list, if you'll pardon my pride."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Today it's... well I can't say it's exactly the same. There's been some push to shut us down. It comes from Dyrwood's more excitable denizens, whose minds are more passionate than thoughtful, I'm afraid. 

"People see this- this Legacy and they see it involves something they don't understand. So it's natural for them to suspect people whose understanding exceeds theirs. It looks to them like we're hiding something."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"We have a representative in the palace this very moment, defending the entire science of animancy at a hearing before the duc, absurd as it sounds. If it does not go well, it could be the end of animancy in Dyrwood.

      <DefaultText>"Uncatalogued?" Hiravias blinks in disbelief. "That's the best euphemism I've heard for 'stolen' since I killed my fifth loiterer. He insisted an artifact he looted was 'not in use' and therefore his to take."

His scowl becomes a smile as he adds, "...and that was the first time I constricted a man to death with vines of ivy. In front of his dog. I let the dog go, of course - you think I'm some sort of monster? Don't answer that."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I should've known better than to isolate him. Of course he would resort to deception.
