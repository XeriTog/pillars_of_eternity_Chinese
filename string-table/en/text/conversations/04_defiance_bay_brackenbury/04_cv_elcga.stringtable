      <DefaultText>This dwarven woman is dressed and perfumed like a member of the nobility, but her sun-reddened skin and sweat-stained outfit suggest that she's been out here for quite some time. "'Fraid I don't have time just now."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The woman folds her arms and blushes beneath her sunburn. "You shouldn't go nosing into other people's conversations."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>8</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Then I guess I'll just have to ask someone else about Kendal's disappearance."</DefaultText>

      <ID>11</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Wait, don't go." She steps in front of you. "I've been on edge of late. Didn't mean to offend." She looks you up and down. "So, that little orlan's finally getting serious, eh?"</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>12</ID>
      <DefaultText>Her eyebrows rise. "That little orlan finally got serious about this case, eh?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Charming. I can't imagine why this Kendal fellow would have disappeared on you..."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>17</ID>
      <DefaultText>She bites her lip before she can retort, reddening further. "Fine, fine. Sorry, I just..."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>18</ID>
      <DefaultText>She rolls her eyes. "Real funny. If you weren't here to help me find Kendal..."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>19</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Anyway, I'll tell you whatever I can. What do you need to know?"</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>20</ID>
      <DefaultText>Elcga snorts. "What, is that little whelp too good for a case like this?"</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>21</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I'm sure he has other business to attend to."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />

    <Entry>
      <ID>23</ID>
      <DefaultText>"At least he sent somebody, then."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>24</ID>
      <DefaultText>"What was Kendal doing before he disappeared?" </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>25</ID>
      <DefaultText>"When and where did you last speak to Kendal?"</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>26</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Had you noticed anything different about Kendal lately?"</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>27</ID>
      <DefaultText>"That's all the questions I have right now." </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>28</ID>
      <DefaultText>"He'd started hanging out with a bunch of actors. Seemed alright, except for that woman." She scowls. "That woman with her long, willowy legs and slender arms. Always came around wearing these low-cut dresses and impossible shoes..."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>29</ID>
      <DefaultText>"What was her name?"</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>30</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Enough about her. I had other questions." </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>31</ID>
      <DefaultText>"How do you know Kendal?"</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>32</ID>
      <DefaultText>Elcga coughs. "Right. What do you need to know?"</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>35</ID>
      <DefaultText>Elcga smirks. "We met up from time to time over the past few months. It was just a fling, really, wasn't going to last." She picks at the corner of her sleeve and looks away. "He was a little fool, but a sweet little fool."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>37</ID>
      <DefaultText>She laughs sadly. "The worst blazing rendition of the general's speech from 'The Widow of the Wood' that I've ever heard." She shakes her head. "I love that fellow, but he was a tragic failure. Yet somehow, he managed to get in with an acting troupe."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>38</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I have more questions about Kendal."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>39</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Not right now. Farewell."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>40</ID>
      <DefaultText>The corners of her mouth twitch. "I guess that means you've got nothing new to report." </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>41</ID>
      <DefaultText>Her expression hardens. "I don't know. I never cared to learn it." She uncrosses her arms and lets them slowly fall to her sides. "I didn't realize it might be important."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>42</ID>
      <DefaultText>"A week ago. He came back to my house for a bit of fun. Afterwards, we fell asleep, and when I woke up he was gone. No note, nothing."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>47</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Just the actors and that woman I told you about. Don't know her name, I'm afraid." </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>48</ID>
      <DefaultText>"If you think of any more, you know where I'll be."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>49</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I was hoping I'd see you soon. Found anything yet?" </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>50</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I'm afraid I have bad news. Kendal is dead." </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>51</ID>
      <DefaultText>[Leave] "Nothing right now." </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>52</ID>
      <DefaultText>Elcga lets out a breath. "I... see." Pity, anger, and sadness flicker across her face, almost too quickly to distinguish. "I knew that woman was trouble." She seems lost in thought for several seconds. </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>53</ID>
      <DefaultText>Finally, she turns back to you. "I appreciate you coming to tell me. I think I need some time to myself right now."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>54</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Well, I'm glad someone's on it..." She rolls her eyes. </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>55</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Steel yourself, Elcga. He's dead."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>56</ID>
      <DefaultText>[Lie] "Kendal went to New Heomar to visit family."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>57</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Oh." Elcga blinks. "Really?"</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>58</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Yes. Although he found work up there, so it may be a permanent move."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>59</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Of course not. He's dead."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>60</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Well, thanks for telling me. I would have thought the fool would at least say goodbye." She clears her throat. "No matter. Plenty of fish in the sea, as they say."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>61</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Are you okay?"</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>62</ID>
      <DefaultText>"That evil woman will pay for her crimes over a dozen lifetimes."</DefaultText>

      <ID>63</ID>
      <DefaultText>[Say nothing.]</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>64</ID>
      <DefaultText>She dabs at her eye and barks with a sharp laugh. "Oh, of course. Like I said, he was nothing serious to me. It's just sad to think of someone so young..."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>65</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Yes." Elcga nods slowly. "I hope she does."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>66</ID>
      <DefaultText>Her face slowly contorts from an expression of horror to one of rage. "Get away from me now, you sick bastard."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText>Her face slowly contorts from an expression of horror to one of rage. "Get away from me now, you sick bitch."</FemaleText>
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>67</ID>
      <DefaultText>She doesn't look at you. "Leave me alone."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />

    <Entry>
      <ID>68</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I'm fine... really. Just thinking back about a few things."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Tell me about Kendal."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>72</ID>
      <DefaultText>"What's to tell? He was a pretty young lad. Not the brightest of the bunch, but always pleasant company."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>73</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Don't take this the wrong way, but you deserve more."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>75</ID>
      <DefaultText>She looks at you, taken aback. "Have you no shame, speaking of the dead so? I'm sure you mean well, but..."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>76</ID>
      <DefaultText>She shakes her head. "I appreciate you coming to tell me, but I need some time to myself."</DefaultText>
