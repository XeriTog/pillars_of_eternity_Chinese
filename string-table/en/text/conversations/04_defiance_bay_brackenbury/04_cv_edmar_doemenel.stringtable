      <DefaultText>Lord Gedmar Doemenel is a man of presence. He wears finery in the style of Aedyre nobility, yet there are scars across his knuckles and burns on his neck that few highborn bear. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Know my terms before we proceed." He pauses, watching to see that he has your undivided attention. "You've served my house well thus far. Individuals of your skill are always in demand in House Doemenel. What I require will be both dangerous and illegal, which you have no doubt surmised."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Lord Doemenel's lip curls as you approach him. "It seems my son spoke to you as well. This was not the outcome I had intended. 

"Yet it seems Abrecan may have had a point. Already the Knights look over their shoulders when passing our door." He almost smiles.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Marshal Wenfeld has become a problem. He's taken a particular interest in some of House Doemenel's business activities. 

"He will neither be bribed nor threatened, nor convinced by any other means. He is intransigent. A weed. And if nothing is done, he will turn the full force of the Crucible Keep on us." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Gedmar straightens. "Wenfeld can be found in Crucible Keep of First Fires, one of the most well-guarded buildings in the city. His piety should make it simple enough to corner him."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Gedmar gives you a quick, firm handshake. "My forefathers taught the citizens of Defiance Bay to fear and respect the Doemenel name. In the wake of Hadret's Rebellion, establishing a reputation was... most expedient.

"We don't live in the same world as they. Trouble is brewing, but this time, we must be careful if we want to avoid the crossfire."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He begins pacing behind his desk. "Failure will mark you an enemy of House Doemenel and of many others in power in Defiance Bay." His feet make no sound as he crosses the velvet carpet.

"Tempers are rising in the city, and many are quick to perceive a threat."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"The Knights of the Crucible have grown bold amidst the chaos. They fear the Dozens and their ability to coax an angry mob. 

"They seek to assert their authority the only way they know how - by stomping over every other bastion of power in the city." His hands tighten into fists, the scars sharp and white across his knuckles.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I want the Knights to go to war with the Dozens, not with us. Tensions are high enough that it won't take much to turn them against each other.

      <DefaultText>Lord Doemenel nods in approval. "Well done, indeed. My contacts in the city already tell me of violent plots between the Crucible Knights and the Dozens.
