      <DefaultText>Lady Webb lies still in her bed, an ornate cushion propping her back upright. The blood pooled beneath a gash in her chest is tacky and nearly dry. A shattered glass rests on the floor beneath her dangling hand.

You can feel the faint aura of her fading essence in your ken.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>This woman clutches a thick stack of parchment with spindly, wrinkled fingers, their flesh stretched thin to near translucence with extreme age, a gossamer veil over pale blue veins. Ink splotches and candle burns dot and stripe her hands like a quilt patterned after some great, indescribable truth.

She does not look up from her reading.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"So the messenger conveyed my summons. A miracle that would make the reincarnation of Eothas look like a child's cantrip, surely. It doesn't draw the most inspired minds, messaging. They've failed me so many times of late I nearly sent a cipher after you instead."

She glances up from her readings for the first time and looks you over. "So this is the Watcher who took over Caed Nua. Oh, don't look so surprised, it isn't an attractive expression. I wouldn't be where I am for long if I let details like that escape me."</DefaultText>

As it is, we only have our suspicions about who is in the group and what they intend. Which, I suppose, means we have much in common with them.

      <DefaultText>She closes her eyes, and the lids flicker. Then her face goes still, and her mouth parts, little more than a sliver, and her hand briefly drops open, spilling some of her parchment to the ground, the pages wafting around her legs like the leaves of a dying tree. Her fleshy eyelids peel back, and her gaze is immediately upon you.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"More than most, though very few would know so much as his name. And there is no way of knowing how much of what I've read is true.

      <DefaultText>"What scraps of evidence exist suggest that he has died many times, only to be reborn each time, exactly the same man, Awakened during adolescence with all the knowledge and experience of all his lifetimes. The plots he orchestrates sometimes take hundreds of years to bear fruit.

"Needless to say, this is not the natural order of things. But he is said to be one of Woedica's Favored, and that old bat was never one to let rules get in the way of favoritism."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"That may also explain another supposed 'gift' of his. His body is no boundary to his soul, and he is known to take possession of others, if their souls are weak enough. Often it is for elaborate deceptions, but sometimes he simply forces them to kill themselves. He is not known for his generous supply of pity."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"He is also not one to show himself in any but their most critical matters. If he has directly involved himself in whatever the group plots now, it may be your only chance to find him.

"And once you do find him, IF you can find him, I would not hold my hopes too high if I were you. He is a driven, single-minded man. He will not have the slightest concern for your problems."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She looks down at her hand, rubbing at an old scar. "The same way I come by all my knowledge. Exhaustive research, spying, bribery. Perhaps some less savory measures. Whatever the knowledge demands, I pay in full. There is nothing of greater value.

"Unfortunately, with Thaos, there is also nothing more scarce. He has covered his tracks far too well. His manipulations of the course of history are lost to time now, though I believe they were many."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"This... news of yours makes sense, of course. To dabble in animancy is to puzzle over the secrets of the gods. This would not be the Leaden Key's first action against it.

      <DefaultText>"The Leaden Key's conspiracy is clear now. They have used Engwithan technology to engineer Waidwen's Legacy. And they want people to blame animancy for it.

"As we speak, the duc is holding hearings in the palace. He is listening to arguments for and against animancy. When they finish, he is expected to decide whether to outlaw it. It seems the Leaden Key has been pushing Dyrwood down this path for some time."</DefaultText>

A rattling sigh struggles to escape her throat. "When I was younger, before Dunryd Row, I had many suitors. These were fine-looking men of good stock. But I could see their thoughts and they were... unimpressive. Boys' thoughts. I toyed with their affections. I resented all of them."</DefaultText>

He sits on the edge of the bed next to you. "You know this is how it has to be." His words come freely, absent of all doubt.

You look at Thaos with the wide eyes of someone seeing for the first time and draw your last breath as a black, velvety darkness descends over you.</DefaultText>
