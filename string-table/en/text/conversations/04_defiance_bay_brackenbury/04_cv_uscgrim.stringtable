      <DefaultText>A willowy adolescent boy stands in the center of his cell, gawkish and stoop-shouldered. He stares straight ahead, the occasional blink his only movement, and it is unclear whether he registers your presence at all behind his glassy, doll-like eyes.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>In this state, the barriers between your soul and his are thin and porous, easily bypassed if you should wish it.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You close your eyes and edge forward toward the boy's soul, and as you near, a sudden malaise comes over you. You are cold and warm all at once, sweating and shivering and straining for breath, as you did on the caravan journey. 

The soul you approach is the wrong one, a parasitic plant that strangles its host. It is predatory and pitiless and you have crossed paths with it before. 

Too late does it occur to you to retract, and already you feel yourself plunging into some interminable abyss of thought and memory.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You are standing in a cell now. The same cell, in the sanitarium. The halls are moonlit and empty, and you are waiting.

At the far end of the ward the door opens, revealing a flesh golem in silhouette beneath the stone archway. It makes its usual rounds, the same stops every time, the misbegotten child of despondent creators.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>When the construct is close, you coil yourself up and spring forward, passing out of the boy's body as though it were a membrane. You can sense his body behind you collapsing to the floor, a puppet whose strings are cut. 

You are rushing toward the golem now, bodiless as a gust of wind. Quickly, you think to yourself, quickly, and you feel the strength hemorrhaging from your soul as you dart towards the makeshift abomination. You pass into the golem's shell and overtake the soul implanted within, encircling it, suppressing it, and contained in this new vessel you are strong again. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You step heavy-footed down corridors unheeded by the other constructs and scrutinized only by the wary, untrustworthy eyes of the mad, coming at last to an office piled with books and scribbled papers and the perverse implements of animancy. 

You set your oversized hands upon a large machine, a nest of globes and tubes and coils in the center of the room and go to work, bending wires and unsettling alignments. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Your surroundings are pulled past you, or perhaps you are pulled past them, and they dissolve into a blur. When they settle into place again, you are outside on a clear day standing in front of a crowd stacked high above you on the tiered seats of an amphitheater. 

You are acting for the crowd, standing deliberately still, but this is no play.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>A balding man with rodent-like features is strapping you to a machine, the one you had tampered with. You see your arms for the first time, short and fleshy, unmistakably those of a little girl, but this body is not truly yours - your mind still holds the same determination, the same hardheartedness as before. The body itself is cold and vacuous - unlike the others, this one has no soul of its own.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The man speaks and the crowd applauds with an enthusiasm worthy of a hero's entrance. "Bear witness," he says, and he pulls a lever. The machine shivers and sparks, and a bead of sweat rolls down the side of the man's brow, but the crowd's apprehension quickly gives way to awe as a crystal globe fills with a radiant mist that casts the entire theater aglow.
 
He opens a valve and the glow crawls through a tube along a length of copper wiring that runs to a set of electrodes beneath your armpits. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You feel nothing when it reaches you, as it should be, for you have been leading his work astray periodically for some time, altering notes and settings and playing puppeteer for Hollowborn. But you make it look how people would expect it to look when a body is infused with a soul. In a moment, the machine goes dark, and the man unstraps you, eyeing you with a scientist's concern.

He looks back up at the crowd, "Behold!" he says, but there is obvious hesitation in his voice. Slowly, you take a plodding step forward, then another and another. You look up at the man, giving him the eye contact of which no Hollowborn is capable, and the crowd gasps. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The man looks relieved. "How do you feel?" he asks at a volume meant for the crowd, and this is the moment. At the top of your lungs, you let out a piercing shriek. The man comes towards you, his hands outstretched, but you run the other way, back to the machine.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText> With all your strength, you drive your head into the crystal globe, and it shatters, streaking your head with warm blood. You drive your head down onto the surface of the machine again and again, drawing panicked screams from the crowd, and by the time the man reaches you, your body has already ceased proper function, and merely twitches on the cold ground. 

Satisfied, you depart the corpse in search of another unsuspecting host. 

Who could put their faith in animancy now? </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You are pulled again from your surroundings, transcending the boundaries of memories and lifetimes, deeper and deeper past betrayals and murders and lies upon lies that form the thick webbing of plots beyond mortal comprehension. 

You settle at last on a room you have seen before, expansive, with a tall device encasing an adra monolith at its center. The room is filled with people and the people all look at the deviceâ€¦</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You are yanked suddenly back to reality and the once-catatonic boy in the cell is looking directly at you, appraising, calculating. There is no mistaking now that it is the soul of Thaos ix Arkannon, the man you have been searching for, that gazes out from that borrowed husk.

      <DefaultText>"Is that so?" He makes no effort to hide his disinterest, but he continues to search your eyes.

He makes a slight grunting noise, and his eyes soften for an instant, and it seems, for that moment, that he recognizes you. He opens his mouth to speak, then seems to think better of what he was about to say. His jaw tightens.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I will help you let go."

He dodges backward with startling grace, putting himself out of reach. On his face there is no malice, only the dispassion of a farmer putting down a sick animal. Then, suddenly, he slumps forward.</DefaultText>
