      <DefaultText>As you near the apparition, you are overcome suddenly by a powerful anxiety that sits like a stone in your stomach. The feeling is not quite real, the recollection of an emotion rather than the emotion itself. It wrenches your insides nevertheless.

The apparition's brow is tensed, a look of concern plain across its face.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The apparition shakes its head at you, never breaking eye contact. "You have failed no one. The gods would not ask you to abandon your family. It is your family that has failed you."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The man chuckles mirthlessly. "Perhaps they would. It may come to that one day. This is why we must not fail.

"The heathens are beyond the gods' reach. They do not know better. We are tasked with delivering them to the gods, so that the gods may heal their souls."</DefaultText>

      <ID>32</ID>
      <DefaultText>The apparition gives a solemn nod. "Ours is not an easy calling. People are frightened by new beliefs. They sometimes react with violence. These are the risks we all assume when we take the oath."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"The gods gave us many gifts, but clairvoyance was not among them. They do not judge our actions by their outcomes. They judge them by our reasons. Act out of love for the gods, and you can never be wrong in their sight."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"This was a tragedy you went through, and it will never leave your memory. But you needn't let it burden your soul as well. Leave judgment to the gods."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The apparition looks wounded. "If you believe that, then I have failed you as a teacher. There are many gods so that all people are looked after, no matter who they are or what they've done."</DefaultText>

      <ID>44</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Whatever stain there is upon your soul, the gods can wash it clean. But you must dedicate yourself to them in return. THAT is what makes one deserving. Will you return the faith they put in you?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The pain in your stomach deepens, and you feel for a moment as though you are about to be sick. Your mouth has gone dry.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The man folds his fingers together and presses them to his mouth, thoughtful.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The apparition exhales slowly and its lips press together, a sympathetic rapport in its eyes. It places its hand on your shoulder.</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>53</ID>
      <DefaultText>The knot in your stomach seems to loosen all at once, and the anxiety is replaced with something else entirely, something warm and soothing, and it is something you know you can never repay.

As the vision fades, you start to become cognizant of the many odd looks aimed in your direction. Your last response echoes in your mind.</DefaultText>
