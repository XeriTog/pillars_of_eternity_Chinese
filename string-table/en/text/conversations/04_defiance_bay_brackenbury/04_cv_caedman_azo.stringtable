      <DefaultText>"Yes, well, ETHELMOER hasn't done much good for anybody since he had his soul moved to an INANIMATE OBJECT, so I fail to see why I should let that sway me.

"If animancers all followed the commands of their leaders, where would we be? We'd all be as backward and willfully ignorant as Readceras. We would know NOTHING about life or death, or even ourselves! We would be lost in the dark with no clue as to why."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I... have, yes. No point in lying about it, now that Ethelmoer's involved. I asked for volunteers from our patients and a few brave souls came forward.

      <DefaultText>"Indeed. Many lives have been spent in such pursuits. Writing treatises and poems. But tell me this, how does one verify the truth of a poem? If some philosopher stumbled across the meaning of our existence, how would we know it from a false one?

"These are wasted lives. In animancy there is progress. We are measurably closer to complete understanding because of our work. And that will be true until our work is complete."</DefaultText>

"No one has come that close with the Legacy. It's why I have to continue. Why I have to risk everything here working in secret. It's why you have to lie to Ethelmoer for me. Tell him you've cleared me of all suspicion!"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Azo's nostrils flare and he bares his upper teeth more broadly.

"That's none of your concern! Did one of the others put you up to this? Audmer? That smug weasel.

"Things went... wrong. Everything. I don't know how. I'll never know." He spits on the floor as if to remove a bitter taste from his mouth.</DefaultText>
