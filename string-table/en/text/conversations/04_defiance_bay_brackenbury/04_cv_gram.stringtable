      <DefaultText>This man has the look in his eyes of a hunted animal, and at your approach, he staggers backward to the far corner of his cell, halfway appearing as though he would climb the walls if it would get him farther away from you.

He cries out - a bizarre, primal utterance like nothing you have heard.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Gram looks at you blankly. It is unclear whether he understands you or not, but his panic has momentarily subsided.

He opens his mouth to speak, but the words that come out are half-formed, as though his tongue were cut out. They are impossible for you to discern, if indeed they are words at all.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He looks at you with uncertainty. Slowly, tentatively, he steps closer to the front of his cell, and as he does so, for the first time you can perceive his soul within your ken. It is misshapen, as though maimed by some jagged instrument, and large expanses of it have been gouged out entirely.

You feel no barriers of resistance. If you wanted to, you could look further into Gram's soul.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You project out toward the maimed soul in front of you, merging with it, its confusion and fear becoming yours as it whisks you into its depths.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You're in your cell. A key turns. The door creaks open on neglected hinges. Thoughts come to you in waves, incomplete, broken, fearful.

Standing at the door is a rotund, balding man. His upper teeth and pointy nose remind you of a rat. He beckons, apologetic. You don't want to go. Anything else. In your mind is a single word and the word is "no," but it dissolves before it reaches your lips. You press against the back wall, cornered. You cry out.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>In darkness, you fight against unseen restraints. You cannot move your arms or legs. The man walks into the room carrying a lit candle, its meager flame casting long shadows across books and machinery. Straps bind your arms and legs. Cold metal circumscribes the crown of your head and the breadth of your chest.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The man is sorry. He is in need of raw materials. They dismantled his work and he needs another source. He needs to show them he was right. He thanks you. 

Then he turns a knob and you feel yourself begin to crack from within and you can feel pieces of you torn away, like having your insides chewed by a horde of rats, and you are screaming a scream you can barely hear.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Another night. Heavy footsteps outside your door. Coming for you. You look through a slit in your door. The flesh giant, the artificial being, just outside, but facing left. Facing the end of the hall. The boy there.

The boy looks with interest at the giant, then collapses to the floor like a shed snakeskin. The giant convulses for a moment, then rights itself, turns away, and leaves.</DefaultText>
