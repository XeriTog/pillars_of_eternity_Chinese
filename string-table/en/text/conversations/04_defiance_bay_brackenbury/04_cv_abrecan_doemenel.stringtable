      <DefaultText>Wine splatters the mirror-smooth tiles as Abrecan hurls the goblet. He smashes the carved handle of his pistol into the antique cabinet next to him. The men standing nearest look from Abrecan back to you, their hands ready over their weapons.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He breaks into a smile again, but his grip has tightened around his pistol. "I need that letter. The thieves are holed up in a house in Copperlane. Fetch the missive, and we'll see about finding you a place in House Doemenel."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Lord Reymont is sitting on a gem the size of an aumaua's testicles. It's called the Heart of White March."

His crooked grin widens. "It's also the subject of a bidding war between the Knights of the Crucible and the Dozens. They're fighting for the honor of returning it to its original dwarven owners... who would make powerful allies."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Of course, House Doemenel would like to see that neither the Knights nor the Dozens make friends with the dwarves of White March. Such an imbalance of power would not be in our best interest." He takes another gulp of wine.
