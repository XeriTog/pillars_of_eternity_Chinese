      <DefaultText>A woman stands in the shade of the garden, muttering to herself. She's fixated on the pages of a large and well-worn tome, seemingly oblivious to the blooming flowers and the cool, fragrant breeze. She only looks up when your shadow crosses her page. "Do you mind? I'm rather busy."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"You... Lady of Lament, you really found it!"

Nedyn cradles the musty tome like a newborn. "I can't believe it. It really exists!" She looks back to you. "Thank you so much. This will be invaluable." She almost turns to the book, but at the last moment, she remembers herself and gives you a bag of coin.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She snaps her book shut. "I'm studying soul attachment. We all know that souls move into people at birth and out of them at death, but we still have a lot of questions about what makes them stick, so to speak."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She brushes a stray lock from her forehead. "Souls power bodies and give their tissues life, but only when they're firmly attached. It's separation that leads to a whole spate of soul-related ailments, including the Hollowborn.

"But if we understood how to reattach souls, we could end Waidwen's Legacy. Maybe even conquer death."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Nedyn crosses her arms over her book. "At least we're trying to do something. The only real progress against the Legacy has come from our research. Unfortunately, our critics have seen to it that the public remembers our failures over our successes."

She sighs. "Which can make it rather difficult to get the information we need."</DefaultText>

      <ID>50</ID>
      <DefaultText>"The Theorems could advance my research by leaps and bounds, but Grimda, the High Archivist, worships Wael, which means she has some paradoxical views on sharing and restricting knowledge. And since she's not exactly a proponent of animancy, she tends to restrict the kinds of information that would be useful to me."</DefaultText>

      <ID>75</ID>
      <DefaultText>"'Waidwen's Legacy' refers to the rise in Hollowborn children in the Dyrwood in recent years. Some have also connected it to so-called b&#238;a&#373;acs that blow through Eir Glanfath. There's hardly any reliable data on those, though, so I can't really comment."</DefaultText>

      <ID>76</ID>
      <DefaultText>She sniffs. "I don't much care for the term 'Waidwen's Legacy.' It reeks of superstition, but it's too prevalent to change at this point. Personally, I'd like to see people take a more methodical approach to these matters rather than throwing up their hands and blaming the gods."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Pandgram was an animancer working in the Dyrwood. He had some interesting theories about essence and some rather... innovative techniques for studying it. He was able to reattach souls to bodies after death, although he wasn't able to prevent his patients from degenerating.

"He was controversial, to say the least, but many are starting to realize that he was merely ahead of his time."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>88</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Anyway, because of this, very little of Pandgram's research is in circulation. He's thought to have died several years ago, and the Hall of Revealed Mysteries owns the only copy of his work." She sighs wistfully. "How I would love to have met him."</DefaultText>

      <ID>89</ID>
      <DefaultText>"The Hall of Revealed Mysteries is rather... protective of its books, especially the rarer ones. And Grimda in particular. She hates animancy. Thinks it's dangerous. I don't see how you can run the greatest library in the Dyrwood and be so adverse to the spread of knowledge and research, but I've never understood these religious types."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Nedyn twists her hands together. "Well, there seems to be a tiny problem with reattaching souls after death. The bodies will reanimate and may even retain memories and personality, but they develop a... hunger. For flesh. Living, soul-infused flesh."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Ah... of course." She pulls a ring from her finger. "It may not look like much, but I've always been able to use this ring to generate a little extra money when I was between stipends. It's critical for someone doing research without the benefit of a wealthy patron."

She smiles weakly and hands it to you. "Please, take it. You've certainly given me a resource I couldn't have found on my own."</DefaultText>
