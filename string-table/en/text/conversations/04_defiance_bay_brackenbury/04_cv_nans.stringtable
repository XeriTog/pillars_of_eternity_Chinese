      <DefaultText>An elderly woman peruses the shelves with a quickness and an energy that belie her age. "I'm afraid I don't practice any more, child. Too busy with my research."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I'm an animancer. Used to venture on all kinds of under-funded and ill-fated trips out of the expedition hall when I was your age, but lately, I've found research better suited to my current pace." She pats a creaking knee and laughs.</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>12</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Well, that's something new." She takes the medallion and holds it in front of her nose, watching it twirl in the light. She suddenly hisses. "By the flame! Have you any idea how much this is worth?"</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />

      <ID>14</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Quite a lot, I hope."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />

      <ID>15</ID>
      <DefaultText>"At least six thousand pands."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>16</ID>
      <DefaultText>"A lot, indeed. Something like this'll fetch six thousand pands in the right market." She runs a finger along the medallion's curve. "I'll give you that much if you're willing to part with it."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"It's a deal."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>18</ID>
      <DefaultText>"It may be worth six thousand to a collector, but surely it's worth more to a researcher such as yourself."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>19</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Maybe later. Let's discuss something else."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />

    <Entry>
      <ID>20</ID>
      <DefaultText>"And a fine deal it is." Nans grins. "Let's just keep this little transaction between us, shall we?"</DefaultText>

      <ID>21</ID>
      <DefaultText>"You bargain like a Glanfathan, child. Very well, how does seven thousand suit you?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"It suits me just fine."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>24</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Sounds like you've been doing some research of your own." Nans looks at you slyly. "What do you say? Willing to part with it for that much?"</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>45</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Like I told you, six thousand is a fair price for a rarity like this."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"That chatty old fishwife's been blabbing about me, I see." She laughs and rolls her eyes. "Never trust your secrets to a man with so much salt in his beard. Anyway, let's see what you've got."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Nans examines the scepter, her eyes hooded by crinkled flesh. "Imatl told you true, I'll buy this. Unfortunately, a broken scepter isn't as valuable as he may have led you to believe." She steals a glance at your face, but her fingers tighten around the piece in her hands.

"I'll take it off you for five hundred."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>50</ID>
      <DefaultText>She wraps the pieces up in the folds of her robes. "A pleasure doing business with you. Give my greetings to Imatl next time you find yourself in the Gift."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>51</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Agreed."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"You seem a little too excited. What aren't you telling me?"</DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>54</ID>
      <DefaultText>The corners of her mouth twitch upward. "Sharper than Imatl, I see. The truth is, I could repair the scepter." She runs her fingers along one of the patterned pieces. "It's broken, sure enough, but the pieces themselves are in good condition."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>55</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I'll think about it."</DefaultText>

      <ID>56</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Making it whole again is a matter of alchemy. Expensive alchemy. I've got to soak the broken ends in a fiendsblood compound to reconnect them, never mind the embalming work to restore the enchantments..."

She eyes you. "I could do it to the tune of eighteen hundred pands."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I expect you'll want to watch and see that your money's put to good use. Better get comfortable, then."

She lays out an array of powders, potions, and other obscure ingredients on her desk...</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>59</ID>
      <DefaultText>"This may be the finest work I've ever done, if I may say so. And thank you for giving me the opportunity. Examining a piece like that is a dream come true for someone in my field." 

She gazes at it wistfully. "Take good care of it."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I'm giving you a rare opportunity to work with an Engwithan scepter. Surely you can bring the price down."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>61</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Aye, perhaps if you want to bargain and haggle with every dragon blood vendor and imp horn merchant in the city."

She puffs her sagging cheeks. "Very well. You can have the satisfaction of working an old woman to an early grave for only fifteen hundred."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>

      <ID>62</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Just pay me for the pieces, and don't try to shortchange me this time."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>63</ID>
      <DefaultText>She looks at you again, pursing her thin lips. "As you wish. And knowing that it is such a find, I'll give you seven hundred."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>66</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I'd be happy to repair the scepter, but it's going to cost 1800 pands. The process requires advanced alchemy, and those ingredients don't come cheap."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>67</ID>
      <DefaultText>She shrugs, her eyes lingering on the fragments. "Like I said, I'll pay you five hundred. Afraid there's not as much value in a broken relic."

"Deal?"</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>68</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Nonsense. This could easily be repaired by someone with the proper skills."</DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>70</ID>
      <DefaultText>Her eyes flash under their sagging lids. "I've got the skills, all right. And you know more than the average relic-hunter, I see."</DefaultText>

      <ID>71</ID>
      <DefaultText>...After what feels like hours, she returns to the main hall with you and presents the scepter. Looking at it, you'd never know it had been broken in the first place.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />

      <DefaultText>"I'd like to know more about the sanitarium."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>74</ID>
      <DefaultText>"It's the official center of animancy in Defiance Bay, founded in 2729. And before you get saucy, no, I wasn't around at the time."

"It was built to treat ailments of the mind and soul. Important sort of place to have in a growing city, and its construction marked the end of the animancy slowdown that followed the Baelreach Accident."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />

    <Entry>
      <ID>77</ID>
      <DefaultText>She shakes her head. "A terrible setback for the discipline. A researcher working outside the Bael Marsh shattered the souls of a dozen volunteers."

Her voice lowers to a growl. "Of course, we'll never know exactly what went wrong because the mob tore him to pieces. This mishap bears some of the blame for the slower pace of research in the two and a half decades that followed, but it also helped concentrate practicing animancers here in Defiance Bay."</DefaultText>

      <ID>83</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Oh, I'm afraid I'm too wrapped up in my own research to pay any mind to what else is going on around here. One of the other animancers might know something, though."</DefaultText>

      <ID>86</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Yes, I believe we agreed on a final price of 1500 pands for me to repair the scepter. Unless you've changed your mind and want to sell me the pieces instead?"</DefaultText>
