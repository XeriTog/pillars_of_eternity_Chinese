      <DefaultText>A thick, snarled tangle of dagger-sharp thorns and vines has grown across this passage. As you look on, the entire wall of vegetation seems to move, almost like it were breathing. Thick coils of vines twist and writhe across the gap with a quiet rustle of foliage. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You stride boldly forward into the tangle of vines - only to find them as thick and tough as trees. The vines stir to life immediately upon contact, and soon you are surrounded by a writhing mass of thorns and cutting leaves. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Through the gaps in the twisting vegetation, you catch brief glimpses of what seems to be a wide, circular chamber. From time to time you catch sight of tawny hides, and the rustling of the vines is briefly obscured by low growls. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You hold your breath as you move through, careful not to brush even the smallest leaf on the branches around you. After one precarious moment where a thorny plant leans towards you, only to come short, you find yourself clear of the wall.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You start off well, moving carefully around and past the web of plants. But halfway through, [SkillCheck 0] steps on a dry, dead branch, and a vine suddenly darts forward with unnatural speed.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The vines tighten mercilessly around [SkillCheck 0]'s leg, and the ensuing struggle shakes the surrounding vegetation, stirring it into a writhing frenzy. [SkillCheck 0] finally tears their way free, and limps out past the edge of the wall. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You hold your breath as you move through, careful not to brush even the smallest leaf on the branches around you. Despite your best efforts, you find your shoulder jammed against a flowering branch, and a vine suddenly darts for your legs with unnatural speed. You quickly leap clear, and use the momentum to roll away from the wall. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Moving quickly, you grab [SkillCheck 0] and yank them aside, and the vines miss their target. The motion stirs other plants, however, and the two of you quickly scramble for the far side of the wall. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>One vine finally swings towards you like a slung club, and you find yourself knocked unceremoniously back in the direction you came. The quiet rustling of the vines has become a roar, echoing through the Maw.</DefaultText>
