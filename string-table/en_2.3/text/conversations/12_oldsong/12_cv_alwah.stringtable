      <DefaultText>A young orlan scrambles on the stone floor, pressing her back against the wall and baring her teeth at you. Her fur is patchy and matted.

As you step into the room, she squints and turns her large ears toward you. A heavy sigh escapes her tiny body. "Beasts take me, my eyes mistook you for one of them. Please, get me out of here."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"When Noonfrost began freezing the lake, my sister, Larha, sent me to seek out the cause." She scowls at the dingy room. "The pale elf estramorwn seized me before I could report back.

      <DefaultText>"I don't know how, but they opened the Frost-Hewn Breach at the back of the temple. Sucks warmth and life straight into their frozen god's barren domain." She shivers.

      <DefaultText>She flicks an ear. "Those savages hear reason? You must be smooth-tongued indeed."
