      <DefaultText>The man meets your gaze with a challenge in his eyes.

"Come to see the great Oernos, estramor? He's out for a hunt, but he'll be back. Unlike that lioness, he doesn't stay cooped up in here for long."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He scowls. "Because she holes up at the back of the Maw, surrounded by her pride and the natural hazards of this place. It's not the proper way to meet a challenger. She's got to come out and face Oernos to keep her claim.

"Anyway, her prime has passed. Putting that old beast down would be a mercy at this point."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Someone had to. Would have been good to let the two beasts brawl, but at least we can finally move on. It doesn't do for Galawain's mightiest hunters to skulk and hide in the back of a cave."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"We wait for the big confrontation, but the wait grows... exhausting." He grimaces and runs a thumb along the edge of his axe. "While Sul hides in the back of Maw, Oernos is denied his victory, and we're all denied the champion we deserve."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>His calloused thumb makes a scraping noise against the blade of his axe. "I hate to spoil the tradition of a big showdown, but if she retreats from her fight, then there's no point in waiting. Kill her, and that'll be proof enough that she's not a fit champion."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Einden scratches his unruly beard. "You claim truth. In my eagerness to see a new champion, my eyes missed what yours have seen."

He nods and sighs. "If Oernos is the true champion, he'll triumph despite his disadvantages. Just like Sul always has."</DefaultText>
