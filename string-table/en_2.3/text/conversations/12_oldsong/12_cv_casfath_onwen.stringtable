      <DefaultText>Two wood elves, a man and a woman, wear colorful robes embroidered with a matching emblem: a winged egg.

Apart from their clothing, they couldn't be more different. She folds her arms and continually scowls at the broken walls around them. He, on the other hand, mutters prayers, his shade-dappled face as tranquil as a cloudless sky.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Casfath's face lights up. "Why, she's the goddess of song, art, the sky, and maternity. She's gentle and brilliant, speaking to her followers in dreams, inspiration, and birdsong.

      <DefaultText>He makes a placating gesture. "Relax, On&#373;en, I'm sure he meant nothing by it."

He turns to you. "Forgive my consort. She's been rather excitable of late." He ignores a pointed look from On&#373;en.

"This is not, as you seem to recognize, our actual temple. It's merely a shrine we've set up after this business with the dragon."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>On&#373;en squints at you. "Your vision did reveal that the menace is a dragon, yes?"

She steps back and gives you a long look. "To be honest, I expected the Sky-Mother would summon a whole flock of warriors to fight this monster... I fear so few will be like sparrows attacking an eagle."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Casfath smiles, stepping in front of her. "It's a dangerous beast, but we'd appreciate any assistance you could render. As would the Queen of Birds.

"In fact, if you mean to confront the dragon, perhaps you should seek guidance from Hylea herself. Teir Evron is a sacred space for all the gods, and it's currently the best place to commune with Hylea, given recent events."</DefaultText>

      <ID>29</ID>
      <DefaultText>Casfath nudges her. "What she means is that this is no mere drake, but a fully grown dragon, and one that has willingly moved into a populated area. You'll want every advantage at your disposal, including the blessing of the Sky-Mother herself. I would suggest that you petition her directly at Teir Evron, if you haven't already."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"And the Queen of Birds saw fit to bless us with a capable warrior." He nods to you and folds his hands. "It is a shame that such a rare champion of the skies had to perish. All winged life is sacred to our goddess.

"Still, it is better that we can return to worship at the Nest. Thank you. Not to presume too much, but you might pray to Hylea when you visit Teir Evron. She is grateful to all who aid her."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She sneers. "And if he told you that you could jump off Madhmr Bridge and sprout wings, would you believe that, too?

"It's a foolish superstition and nothing more. The Queen of the Birds blesses us with her attendants so that we can hear their songs, not eat their flesh."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She throws her hands up to the heavens and shakes her head. "But no. You advised caution. Now word's spread that the dragon ate a few of our followers, and anyone willing to slay it wants an anamfath's ransom for the job."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He folds his hands. "Contrary to On&#373;en's suggestion, I am in favor of sending someone to kill the dragon. But I suggest a smaller party, and one willing to seek Hylea's blessing."

      <DefaultText>Casfath nods slowly. "This is true, which is why midwives are widely considered clergy of Hylea. As are many artists and poets.

"In any case, those of us who follow her feel closest to her splendor in a place where we may share light, song, and a view of the blessed sky."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"But if Hylea has tasked you, then who are we to doubt? On&#373;en is right, however. You must prepare yourself for a powerful and crafty foe.

"The Nest - and the dragon - are perched atop a mountain beyond the Northweald." He points northward along the path. "Follow this trail into the wilderness, and then look for another path carved into the cliffs. May the Sky-Mother's blessings aid you."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Casfath places a hand on her back. "If the Queen of Birds saw fit to conceive such a creature in her own skies, then who are we to destroy it?"

He looks at the mountain pass. "This is not the outcome I have prayed for, but perhaps it is Hylea's will nonetheless. Perhaps speaking to her at Teir Evron will illuminate the matter."</DefaultText>
