      <DefaultText>Yet there is something off-putting about his gaze, which has the piercing, too-bright quality of the sanitarium patient. He watches you intently, for several moments, and then speaks. His voice is taut with strain - but you cannot understand the words. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"We were attempting to find a means of binding souls to their mortal vessels, preventing them from crossing the Shroud. I say attempting - we found it, of course. A dozen minds, set to purpose. How could we not?" </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"The things we learned! What a glorious time. We could determine the precise manner in which a soul would crack and shatter.

    <Entry>
      <ID>103</ID>
      <DefaultText>"And no amount of certainty will make the imbibing of poison a pleasant experience. Death is the ultimate test, you see. If the soul has flown, then you know you've failed." He chuckles.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"The big question. Binding a soul to its body was not, it turned out, very difficult. We were certain we'd found a kind of immortality. The body could be destroyed beyond repair, but anything less is quite survivable." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I was eager to attempt it. My leg, at the time, pained me terribly. Old war wound. And I had heard one subject describe a sense of... distance from the pain inflicted upon them. They felt it, but it didn't matter to them. Which would be a vast improvement!" </DefaultText>

      <ID>108</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I remember the first moment. The relief." He sighs. "...But we found that after some time the body would remember that it was, after all, dead. There's really no describing what it feels like, to see your own fingers rotting away." He makes a face. "The smell." </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>109</ID>
      <DefaultText>"To the point, I see. Binding a soul to its body is no great feat, if you know how. When we discovered the means, we were certain we'd found a kind of immortality. The body can still be wholly destroyed, freeing the soul within, but anything else is quite survivable." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Od Nua wasn't terribly pleased with the distraction, but that turned out not to matter. The mob came and murdered him, and we were sealed in here with the rest of his tools.

      <DefaultText>"And so." He grins. "We had a time of it, we did. We were able to preserve the furniture, over the years. We had little meetings, in the grand chamber. What a nice little family we were." His grin fades. "Until it had to end." </DefaultText>
