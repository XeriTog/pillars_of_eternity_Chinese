      <DefaultText>This spirit stands stiffly at attention, her gaze focused on the end of the hallway. One arm bears up a heavy round shield, though the rippling blur of soul energy obscures what lies upon it. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Her head turns a little.

"They've passed the blight forges. If the overseers live, we may stop them yet in the chambers beneath." She snorts. "If Cabiros and his pack of scheming wizards haven't betrayed us." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"The mob may be on us soon. Better to make peace with whatever god will have you." She pauses, looking at you. "Are you afraid?" </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She nods, once, and turns away again. "No shame in that. You're still here. The Sisters have gone below, to hide beneath Od Nua's robes, or else preserve our lord's life. Depends how you look at it." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Of course. Not you nor I." She turns away. "Nor are your hands shaking. No matter. You're here. We'll bring a fight to them that they'll remember."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Indeed. What's to fear at all?" She looks away from you. "Our own people turn against us. What remains, if we are victorious? Who will feed the machines then?" </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Come - we'll rally the defense at the steps. Funnel them into our blades. With the animats beside us, they won't stand a-" </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The spirit gasps, wordlessly, mouth agape. She gropes for something at her back, unseen, and takes a listing step sideways, away from you. Her eyes, wide, gaze into yours. "You... trai..." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"These... Children of the Wheel. What do they care about Od Nua's grief? They think he's promised them immortality. And now they've killed us in the pursuit of it." </DefaultText>

      <ID>20</ID>
      <DefaultText>"None of this would have happened, if not for them. They have driven our great lord from grief and into madness. Pushed him into these deeds." She pauses. "He was a great king. Perhaps he will be again." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"While Od Nua contents himself with his titan, they dig after the very heart of heaven." She gives a sour laugh. "Madness. All of it. And yet Od Nua holds them close at his side." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I do not fear the battle. I fear what will become of our lord, once we are victorious. What further madness the Children of the Wheel will pour into his ears. Perhaps he would stop once his son is returned to him. But will they let him?" </DefaultText>
