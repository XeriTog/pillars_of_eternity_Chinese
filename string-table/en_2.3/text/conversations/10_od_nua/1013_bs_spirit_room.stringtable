      <DefaultText>A hazy form stands before you. From time to time the blurring features resolve into what you take to be an elven man.

"I can't do this anymore. How am I going to explain? How can we possibly give him what he wants?" The spirit speaks in quick, hushed bursts of Engwithan, and shakes his head as if to answer his own questions.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The figure paces a few steps, raising his hands to his temples. "What we cannot give him! Even after all this time, there is so much we do not know. He wants his son. The boy he knew, whole and preserved, returned to him." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"But people - souls - they don't always remember. Who's to say his son will remember being his son at all? Remember his father's face? I... I have seen mothers forget their children..." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"He has brought... so many people, down here. I hear such terrible things from the upper floors. Even here, these... these constructs... I cannot sleep." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I'm... I'm hiding. I passed by one of the machines, and I suddenly... I couldn't breathe. I was thinking about the work we've done. The things we've seen. How even small deeds can scar the soul. Is mine so ragged?" </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>His voice lowers. "I think sometimes that I will wake and find myself inside one of the animats. Will I even know? Will it not be like waking one day to find myself blind and mute?" </DefaultText>

      <ID>14</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I-I didn't think it would go so far. I didn't know. Od Nua is our liege lord. How can I refuse him?" </DefaultText>

      <ID>15</ID>
      <DefaultText>He looks up, startled, looking past you. "N-no, I'm not-! I'm not saying anything like that. I'm... I'm only frightened, Aia. I'm sorry. Don't tell anyone, please." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"O-of course! I am a devoted servant." His voice goes high with terror. "I didn't mean - Please, I never meant that I would ever renounce my oaths."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"It is only that I fear him." The figure shivers, looking at something beyond you. "One may fear a lord and obey him still. It is, in fact, far easier than the alternative." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>A hazy form stands before you. From time to time the blurring features resolve into what you imagine might be a thin, elven man, gaunt and weary. 

He speaks, seemingly to himself, in low and anxious tones. You cannot understand his words, for he speaks in a strange tongue. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The spirit does not seem to hear you. Or at least he does not respond, save to put his head in his hands. </DefaultText>

      <ID>27</ID>
      <DefaultText>The spirit lingers yet, still murmuring to itself in frantic bursts of ancient words. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I am servant to Od Nua. My sword arm is pledged against his enemies. My soul is sworn to his purpose."</DefaultText>
