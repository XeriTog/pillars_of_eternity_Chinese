      <DefaultText>This wide pit descends into a grim darkness. You hear the whistling howl of wind, and from time to time hot gusts of air tug at your clothing. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You take a grappling hook from your pack, and tie it off neatly around one of the heavy stone blocks surrounding the pit. A few hard tugs suggest that the rope will hold fast.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The chasm appears to have been dug out with tools, rather than being a natural formation. It seems to be very deep, but you cannot see the bottom to gauge the distance. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Soon enough, however, you see another source of light, far below. Past the dangling end of the rope, you can see a dimly lit room, at the center of which is a circular stone pool. The pool is filled with blood, and even at this distance you can pick out various limbs and mangled bodies, largely xaurip in nature. The tunnel bored into the stone ends a ways above the chamber below, and your rope extends no further.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Crouching down, you grip the edge of the chasm and seek a foothold further down. Finding it, you begin to slowly and laboriously work your way down the side of the wall. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You manage to keep your grip on the rock face, even as you descend further and further into the earth. At last, you spy a faint light beneath you. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The climb is long and arduous, and though you start well, you tire in time. At the point at which you consider climbing back up, you find your grip failing. Your hands slip - and you fall backwards into the pit. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The chasm rushes past you in a whirling blur of gray stone and darkness. As you fall, you see a faint circle of light far below, rising swiftly - and then the flat, gleaming surface of a pool so deep a red as to seem black. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Keeping a firm hold on the rope, you begin your descent into the darkness. Soon the edge of the pit is far above your head, and you can hear only the creak of the rope and your own breaths. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Bracing yourself for the landing, you loosen your hold, dropping down the remaining distance to land within the pool of blood with a noisy splash.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The thick, murky waters hinder your swimming, threatening to pull you down into the unseen depths of this grim pit. But at last you crest the surface, and pull yourself up and over the brim - to find yourself at the edge of a reeking, sludgy mixture of blood and limbs.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The climb is long and arduous, and though you start at a good pace, your party begins to tire in time. [SkillCheck 0] pauses to rest, only to be overcome by fatigue. With a startled cry, [SkillCheck 0] falls, striking others free of the wall on the way down.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You strike the surface hard, and plunge into the crimson waters, finding them deep and dark. Your senses are immediately assaulted - the copper tang of blood within your mouth, a red haze across your vision. The surface slides up out of reach.</DefaultText>
