      <DefaultText>This xaurip is lying in a corner of the chamber. Its ribs show starkly beneath its scaly hide, and its breathing is labored, each whistling breath causing obvious discomfort. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The xaurip barely makes a sound - there is a muted, wet gurgle, and then the creature lies still, blood pooling beneath the withered body. Soon enough its eyes are glassy, empty of life.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You look the sick creature over, and notice that its skin shows some discoloration, with ugly patches of yellow and livid purple. You note that these seem to coincide with the placement of the ritualistic paint that has been daubed onto the creature. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You look the sick creature over, and notice that its skin shows some discoloration, with ugly patches of yellow and livid purple. It seems to match the symptoms of a common poison, known as Mocga's Tears. </DefaultText>
