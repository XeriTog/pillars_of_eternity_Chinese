      <DefaultText>Cast in orange hues by the guttering torches, a massive creature sits at the rear of this wide chamber. There is an acrid stench of blood and offal about the room, and a hot, malodorous gust wafts towards you as the ogre rises, stirring up the dust beneath its feet.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"If they had only known how many unwitting fools would wander into my camp, I would not have been exiled." Despite his words, the ogre studies you dispassionately. His pale, grim features are streaked with dried blood.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"But then, I think they have lost the taste for [Player Race], now that they have feasted on one another for so long." The ogre turns away. "I will not be fattened for the eating."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"And it might have, if the xaurips had not recently grown sick. Now their poison has infected us... and Zolla will not let us leave, even if we wish to try." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Wait..." Thulgar looks down at you. "You must be powerful, to venture through these caverns. There are far worse creatures than even us, down below." He takes in a deep breath. "Perhaps you are strong enough to put an end to Zolla." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Matron Zolla... she was plagued with dreams from the moment we came here. Terrible dreams, of something down below. She was convinced we should not go there." Thulgar lowers his head. "I told her it was nothing. Thought nothing of it, until we discovered the poison within the xaurips. It changed her." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"We have lived here for many years. The caverns have changed around us. Many old tunnels have been closed - perhaps it's the spiders' doing. For a time we feasted on the xaurips, and lived well. But the xaurip tribes have become diseased. Poisoned." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Thulgar gives you a searching look, frowning. "That is what Zolla called it... the voice in her dreams. After we came, we began to have terrible visions. We would feel a presence, sometimes... I thought it superstition, until I heard it too. And then I thought it an effect of the poisons we were eating." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Some of us went on eating the xaurips, of course, even knowing. There was nothing else. They died painfully, but quickly. Others tried venturing out into the great stair, trying to find a way out. Zolla forbade us from leaving, in time.

      <DefaultText>"Whatever the voice spoke, she grew harder, colder. Perhaps it was enough that the voice was never silent, through all those days and nights. Perhaps the poison made the dreams all the worse... It is harder, perhaps, to see madness in those closest to you. But I should have seen it all the same." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Thulgar pulls himself up to his full height, reaching for the massive club propped up against the wall of the cavern. "I cannot die while she lives. Perhaps some fresh meat will strengthen my resolve." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"We did not notice at first. Not until we, too, began to grow weak. Some of us became like feral creatures, maddened by the poison. Matron Zolla, strongest of us... she did not go so easily. Her madness came slowly." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I cannot raise a hand against her. She is my mate still. Eternally. I have tried to bring myself to do it many times. Perhaps I would fail, but I cannot even try.
