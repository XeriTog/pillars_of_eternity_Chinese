      <DefaultText>A man turns to face you, wiping blood from his estoc. His knit brows betray a moment of confusion. But as he watches you, a slow, confident smile creeps over his face. "The Iron Brand does not meet many travelers this far from the road. What would they be doing out here?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>A dwarf curses and spits into the grass. "It's a rhetorical question, you dimwit." He tightens his grip on his sword. "Everyone knows the roads between the villages are crawling with brigands. They're obviously bandits... same as us."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The bandits look at one another. The elf opens his mouth to speak, but the others are quick to silence him.

Their leader flashes that confident smile again. "An egg in good condition could easily fetch 400 pands from the right buyer. But, since we were here first, we'd have to add a finder's fee to account for our time and effort..."</DefaultText>
