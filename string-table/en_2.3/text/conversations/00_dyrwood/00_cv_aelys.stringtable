      <DefaultText>Aelys' gaze is cloudy and distant. The vengeful essence of the Skaenites swarms her soul like ants on a dying moth.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Hylea's wings, I can hardly remember a thing." She pauses, her brow furrowing. She mutters something in a dialect of Rauatai. Then Vailian. "Ba nom e... No. My name is... Aelys." Her fingers dance at her side, plucking at the air in three repeated motions. "A lyre. The opening notes of 'The False Knight.' I..." Her twitching fingers brush her swelling abdomen.

She looks back at you, a question in her eyes.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She nods absently. "I also know I can't go back to the village, though I don't remember why." She looks around at the strange machinery. "And I certainly can't stay here..."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"You should find your way to a big city. New Heomar, perhaps, or even the Vailian Republics. Somewhere with plenty of opportunities."</DefaultText>
