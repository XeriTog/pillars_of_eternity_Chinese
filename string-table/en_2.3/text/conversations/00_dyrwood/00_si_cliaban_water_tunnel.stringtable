      <DefaultText>You hear running water and see a small stream that carves its way into the mountain.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>A shallow bottom flickers and wavers just under the water's edge, but as you look toward the tunnel, the bottom disappears into darkness. From here, it's impossible to tell how deep the stream is.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>However, a faint light plays along the walls of the tunnel. The echo of rushing water suggests that the tunnel and stream continue for quite some distance.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You take slow, sloshing steps toward the mouth of the tunnel, holding yourself upright while the current tugs at your legs. The cold water leaves you gasping, and as it rises past your waist, you fight to control your breaths. The streambed soon drops out from under your feet, and the current pushes you toward the tunnel with growing force.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The current pushes you through the tunnel faster and faster, tugging you downward. Over your head, the tunnel narrows and drops, leaving only a thin pocket of air. You take a final deep breath before the current drags you into the depths.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Rays of light pierce the darkness, but the current is moving too fast now for you to see more than flickering glimpses as you speed by.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You keep your hands in front of yourself and focus on avoiding the jagged rocks that appear suddenly in the darkness, jutting from the walls.

A light winks at you up ahead. You're approaching it fast, but it looks to be the mouth of a second, smaller tunnel. You might be able to reach it, but your lungs have started to ache.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>With swift, sure strokes, you pull yourself out of the current's grasp and back to the safety of the water's edge. Behind you, the stream rushes into the tunnel.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You wrap your fingers around the rocks lining the tunnel and peer into it. It terminates in a dead end, but something glints among the rocks at the far side. Reaching it would be a challenge for anyone without strong lung capacity.</DefaultText>

      <ID>17</ID>
      <DefaultText>You rush past the side tunnel and see a corkscrew turn up ahead. You angle your body with the current just in time to avoid the onrushing wall. 

The contortion forces the last burst of air from your lungs.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The last of the light disappears behind you. You can't tell whether the tunnel has gone dark or whether you're blacking out from lack of air. In either case, you can no longer see the walls around you. You extend your feet in front of you and hope for the best.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Your foot strikes an outcropping. Your arm grazes another. The pain has you gritting your teeth, but it's not as bad as you'd feared. Either the cold waters have numbed your skin or you've slowed.

Your chest begins to hitch. You clamp your jaw shut and tighten your throat against the choking waters, but soon, your body's reflexes will take over.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>A halo of light appears above you. The current is no longer pushing you toward it, so you kick, push, and twist your body up, the surface always seeming just out of reach.

At last, your head breaks the surface. You gulp air into your aching lungs and pull yourself to the edge of the pool. Crawling out of the water, you look at the cavern around you as you massage feeling back into your aching, cold-numbed limbs.</DefaultText>
