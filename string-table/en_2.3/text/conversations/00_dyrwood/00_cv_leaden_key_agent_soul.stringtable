      <DefaultText>A haze of essence lingers over the body, as faint and insubstantial as a dust plume in a rider's wake. 

Yet as you draw closer, whispered instructions echo in your ears and anticipation warms your blood.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>In a vision, you see the same stone machine you approached moments ago, but from a different height and angle, as if through different eyes. 

You'd heard rumors that some of your brethren were sent here months before. Yet you see no sign that anyone has been here - in fact, the cobblestones are covered in a fine layer of dust. Ash.

You know suddenly what this will cost you. And you are ready.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You and your companions take up your positions. You share a final look of affirmation between yourselves. They don't know your name and you don't know theirs, but you know that you're doing the work of the gods together. None of the rest matters.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Two carved bands of stone in the middle of the machine grind into motion. They rotate in opposite directions, picking up speed until they spin like freshly greased carriage wheels. 

A wind shrieks through the cavern, accelerating with the stone rings. You press your hands to your ears and grit your teeth against the noise. You're about to shut your eyes when you glimpse new movement.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Rows of triangular flaps around the machine open like petals. You don't know what's happening in the machine, but you feel a tingling at your extremities. Searing pain spreads through your body, a hot knife separating every tissue and ligament within you.

All the while, it feels as if you're falling toward the machine, your stomach mashed against your spine.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>What happens next is too fast to process. 

You awaken from the vision to find yourself kneeling and gasping for air. Holding your head, you let the tiles between your knees gradually come into focus.

As you catch your breath, you remember the strange scene you saw outside Cilant L&#238;s, where several robed figures fell amidst a howling b&#238;a&#373;ac. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Looking at the ash scattered across the cavern floor, it is apparent that the Leaden Key has been doing this - whatever it is - all over the Dyrwood.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The orders were clear. The effects of the machine in Cl&#238;aban Rilag were wearing off - a child had been born not far from Dyrford recently, its soul intact. The machine would need to be reactivated.</DefaultText>
