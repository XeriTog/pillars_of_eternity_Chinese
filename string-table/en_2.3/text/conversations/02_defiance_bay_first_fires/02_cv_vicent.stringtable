      <DefaultText>"Ah, yes! This is true." His jovial countenance hardens. "I'm told you are the one who killed Mestre Verzano. His fate was not entirely undeserved. Though I'm sure you afforded him a quicker and cleaner death than the Doemenels would have offered."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"But, onto business. A rather notorious adventuring party calling themselves the Forgotten have made a name for themselves by raiding Engwithan ruins in the Dyrwood and selling the stolen relics to their patrons back in the Vailian Republics.

"I need them stopped. I'm sure you're aware that trade in Engwithan relics is strictly forbidden in the Dyrwood. Were it known that prominent nobles in the Republics were flagrantly defying the duc's ban on the looting of Engwithan ruins, it would put a number of valuable trade agreements in jeopardy or even cause Defiance Bay to embargo Vailian goods. I can't let that happen."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"A lucky break for me. A prominent merchant in the Republics, Mestre Barcozzi, has also developed an interest in obtaining Engwithan relics and sent a buyer to Defiance Bay to meet with the Forgotten.
