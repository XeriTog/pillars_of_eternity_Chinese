      <DefaultText>The room below is animated amidst a heated debate. All the representative groups are easily discerned in the crowd. Crucible Knights, stiff in their noisy armor, sit in one section. In another are well-dressed members of House Doemenel, casual, watching with a predator's interest.

Interspersed are animancers in their academic's robes with expressions either sour or concerned.</DefaultText>
