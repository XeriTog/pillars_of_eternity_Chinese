      <DefaultText>"My name is Ellitherion. They call me 'Haggard Shoes', for all the walking I used to do, and all the boots I wore down. But those days are well behind me. My eyes have seen a great deal, and now my ears get their fill from the travelers who come through here." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Of course." Ellitherion's face brightens. "I founded the inn many years ago, but in many ways its tale begins much earlier. It was while I was returning from a long journey south that I first heard the story of the tree upon which this inn rests." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Hundreds of years ago, a strange event occurred. The sky was troubled that night, with many stars falling across the sky, and one of those same stars began to plummet, instead, towards Eora. It fell here - striking a young tree and burying itself within it like a fiery heart." </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />

      <ID>16</ID>
      <DefaultText>"But the tree survived. And over the years, it grew - and grew, and grew, twice as big as its fellows in half the time. Until it reached the size you see now, and grew no more."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Hearing the tale, I knew I must find the truth. And you see it there - " He gestures towards the large stone at the center of the room. "Around the tree's heart, I built this inn - to welcome all travelers who might look upon it." </DefaultText>
