      <DefaultText>Two identical women seem to fade into view as they move away from the great trees that camouflage them. Their skin is tree bark, ridged and scaly, wreathed in a curling tangle of roots, buds, and blooms.

Their hair hangs beneath the shade of serrated leaves like the drooping branches of the elms above, and the pupils of their eyes are encircled by hundreds or even thousands of concentric rings, as if to mark the accumulated wisdom of millennia.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>One of them extends a snarl of roots toward you that snakes and twists together to form something like an open hand, palm down.

"Turn around, flesh-creature. Outsiders are not permitted to approach the Elms." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The other stares at you unblinking, and as her frown deepens her face creaks.

"Do you not feel it, sister? Something... familiar. An ancient soul, like the other one. Another defiler, no doubt. Let us fell him and be troubled no more. It would pay the debt of his predecessor."</DefaultText>

R&#238;henwn opens her mouth to respond but all that escapes her knotted lips is an exasperated, rustling sigh.

"Clearly that man did not want to be followed. Whatever the relationship here, I suspect it is anything but cordial."
