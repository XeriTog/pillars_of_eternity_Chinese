      <DefaultText>You kneel and pray to Berath. Even while your eyes are closed, you see a road that seems to stretch on forever. The stars wheel overhead in a clockwork rotation of constellations, disappearing over the horizon to your left only to rise on your right. 

You try to make out the details on either side of the road, but your eyes can't seem to focus. One moment you think you see a meadow blanketed with mist and another sheer canyon walls. For just an instant, you even see waves lapping at the edges of the road.

Were you to step into the shifting landscape, you feel certain you would only end up back on the road.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>As you pray to Berath, you again find yourself on the road.

Squinting into the distance, you see a short, pale figure waiting for you. At first, you think it's another vision of Archdruid Rehstin, but then you notice the figure's skeletal frame and rictus grin. He stands in front of another skull gate, but way leads down, not onward.

He beckons for you to approach. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You remember the door to Cl&#238;aban Rilag and the two figures carved into the mountain next to it. One looks vaguely male and the other vaguely female. Only a thin layer of flesh covers their skeletal bodies, which twist to face the doorway between them.

The doorway, however, is not what you saw in the ruins. It's a skull, gaping and jawless, and as you look on, its open mouth seems to grow.

The arms of the two stone sculptures are swept toward the mouth, inviting you in. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You turn only to see the same scene at the other end of the road - the jawless skull flanked by two skeletal effigies. 

As you look on, the sculptures turn their heads toward you. Their fingers slowly curl, beckoning you.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The road continues through the maw to another shifting landscape surrounded by stars. As you pass through it, you see an identical doorway in the distance. A dwarven man stands near it, unmoving.

You turn and look behind you, only to see the skull gate you just passed facing you. An elven woman waits in the road. Like the dwarf, she stands still.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You continue down the road toward him. He looks up as you approach, but you can't tell if he's looking at you or through you. His face is smooth but flaccid, as if the flesh has detached from the muscles underneath. 

As you look on, his face begins to change. Wrinkles crack at the corners of his eyes. His mouth sinks, carving deep lines from his nose to the corners of his lips. His jowls sag, and the loose flesh hangs like dough.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You start toward her. There's something unnatural about the way she stands. She's too still. 

When you get closer, you see that her legs taper into a slender trunk, and in place of her feet are gnarled, twisting roots.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He raises his cupped hands. They're covered in blood. He lifts them to his face and smears himself, from his newly-creased forehead to the wattles of his neck. As he massages the dark, sticky fluid into his skin, the fresh wrinkles disappear. The hanging folds recede, and his flesh tightens as if re-adhering to his skull.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He lifts his head, and this time, you know he's looking at you. His renewed face looks like a mask, artificially smooth and still. Behind it, his black eyes are two hungry pits, yawning like the empty mouths of skulls.

"Come. Make your sacrifice to the Ethik N&#244;l."

His body blocks the path. He extends a bloody hand toward you.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You grab his hand, but his skin gives too easily under your grip. As you try to pull away, you hear a noise like dried canvas tearing.

His skin splits, following a long seam that begins at his arm and stretches the length of his body. Blood gushes forth in such quantities that you can't imagine there was ever anything else in him.

Sure enough, as the dwarf empties of blood, he collapses like a desiccated husk. The blood in the path gleams with a thousand souls' worth of essence. The essence evaporates, trailing shining filaments into the night sky.

Only now that he is dead can you continue onward.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She lifts her face to an invisible sun. Her long, golden hair is the color of autumn leaves, and as you look more closely, you realize that her head is actually covered with tendrils and vines sprouting brilliant yellow leaves. Each glimmers with the essence of an entire soul.</DefaultText>

      <ID>52</ID>
      <DefaultText>She gives you a beatific smile. As you look on, the leaves slowly fall from her head and settle at her roots. They melt into the path beneath her, and almost immediately, new leaves sprout in the place of the old.

She reaches toward you, still smiling as roots spring from her fingertips. Her outstretched arms bar the path.

"Come. Graft your soul to the Golden Grove."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Her roots twine around your fingers, and as they do, they grow rigid and cold. Her outstretched arm petrifies, and as a rough, stone bark overtakes her flesh, she can only look on in horror.

You break away from her brittle grasp.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Her feet are rooted in place, but she twists and writhes as if trying to flee her own dying limb. The petrification reaches her shoulder and spreads down her body, freezing it in a painful arc. It creeps up her neck, and she throws her face skyward like a drowning swimmer. 

The grayness covers her face, freezing her gasp in stone.

Now that she is still and lifeless, you can continue past her.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Only the golden leaves on her head remain untouched, and as you watch, they fall one by one to the path below. They shrivel as the shimmering essence fades from them.

A voice echoes along the road, barely more than a whisper on the breeze. "Return them to the Wheel."

She has been petrified. Her legs taper into a slender trunk, and her feet are roots anchoring her to the path. Gone is the golden hair you remember - her head is as bare as a tree stripped by winter.</DefaultText>

The empty husk of his corpse collapses onto the road.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Two identical cave mouths wait up ahead, and you follow the Usher to one of them. Standing at the edge and gazing down, you see an endless, ever-changing plain bisected by a road. Only then do you realize that you're no longer on the road.

As you follow the road to the point where it disappears below you, you realize that you're standing in one of the eye sockets of a massive skull.

The Usher points to the road.</DefaultText>
