      <DefaultText>An elf stands on a dais in the middle of a clearing. The ground is blanketed with leaves in various shades of russet and gold. Her eyes are closed and her arms folded in front of her. A curtain of autumnal yellow hair hangs in front of her face. As you draw near, she lifts her chin and looks at you with shifting hazel eyes.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Her mirthless laughter sounds like water breaking on rocks. "What is a god that his voice should carry so far? And what are you that you should so eagerly obey?

"The gods only have dominion over what we cede. And you would cede matters of life and death to them."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"High Ovate. An ancient elm among poles and saplings. We have taken root in the same soil, and the others grow in my shade."

Her eyes pulse with a deep, summery green. "Their roots nourish my soil. My branches give them shelter. Together, we grow."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Every mote of essence, every fiber and tendon and speck is the result of a thousand beginnings and the origin of a thousand more creations. The world is a shoot unfurling from the soil, ever growing and expanding and scattering new seeds to the wind."

She bows her head. "Go, then, and gather the windfall."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>A wrinkle of distaste curls her lip. "A swarm of maggots on a dead songbird. Worms hollowing a mighty spruce. They celebrate the withering of life rather than its budding. 

"They seize strength from others instead of accepting what Weretha freely gives."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Her eyes dim to a blackish brown. "They take pride in their independence from the gods, yet their leaders demand an even greater sacrifice. Death for life. Strength from the spent essence of their petitioners.

"The Ethik N&#244;l offer another kind of servitude, and one to kith whose souls have long since rotted."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Through work. And wisdom. The greater the tree, the more fruit it may yield." She nods at the ovates gathered in the clearing. "They are vines climbing an ancient elm into the sunlight. My growth sustains them. Should our harmony fall prey to a god's jealousy?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>A storm of protest brews behind her color-shifting eyes. She says nothing for several seconds, but you see the fury slowly drain from her face as her eyes fade to the brown of dead leaves. Finally, Erona lowers her head. "Your words carry truth. And shame.

"It was never my desire to diminish my followers, but I can see where perhaps my roots left no room for them to grow."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She gives you a mischievous half-grin while her eyes fade to gray. "The words on my lips are the language of the stream cleaving stones and the wind guiding seeds. If you do not understand, it is because the tongues of kith have deafened you."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Very well. If my season has ended, then let me pass with it." As she closes her eyes, the warmth and color drain from her body. Her breathing slows, her ashen skin stiffening with a dull patina. 

When the last sigh that leaves her lungs, cracks carve their way across her flesh, dividing it into hardened ridges. Within seconds, Erona has petrified, her bark-encrusted face turned toward the ovates below the dais.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I didn't cede half my face to Galawain by choice," Hiravias grumbles form beside you. "I wish her sentiment to be true, but agelessness has made her ripe with folly. The gods may be fickle and hard to know, but they are not constrained by our permission."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Durance laughs thickly with derision. "The gods set the rules and let us do as we will, but that is merely a test, and only a fool thinks he has been ceded anything. You do what your god wants or you face the fire.
