      <DefaultText>A young man approaches you with a swift and purposeful stride. While you've never met him before, he has the same stern, wild look as Simoc.

He doesn't speak until he's right next to you. When he does, his voice is quiet. 

"Wait. I saw you speaking with my father."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Lliras' weapon is drawn, and his eyes burn with anger. He looks more like his father than ever. "I knew my father was a soulless beast, but you..."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He glances back at the room with Simoc. "He's asked you to sacrifice Vela, hasn't he?"

He grits his teeth. "Maybe he's right about Three-Tusk Stelgaer growing weak. But if this is the price of strength, it isn't worth it. The tribes have survived this long because we've stuck together."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He frowns. "There's an herbalist among the Ovates of the Golden Grove. Bledha, that's her name. They all gather southeast of here, by the river. 

"She could brew a poison. Simoc wouldn't know the difference until it's too late."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>His voice rises, high and angry. "That we should murder a child because he's afraid of change?"

He grimaces, looking at the nearby warriors. His voice returns to a whisper. "The Broken Stone War was bad. But do you know the kinds of tactics he encouraged? Raiding farming settlements. Slaughtering villagers who'd never even trespassed."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"He says this brutality is all that keeps the estramorwn from invading our lands. Sometimes I wonder if it's what caused the War of Black Trees.

"Maybe there's another leader who'll rise from our tribe. Or maybe this is the gods' way of saying that Simoc's time is over."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"It's complicated. A child sent to be fostered by another tribe isn't allowed to return. Unfortunately, explaining that we're shielding her from my father would make matters much worse - for both tribes." He tugs at a thin braid.</DefaultText>

He steps forward again. "This stops now."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He scowls. "I hope you don't have to think too hard about it."

With another glance at Simoc's chamber, he backs toward the door. "I'm warning you now, estramor. Don't go anywhere near Vela. I'm my father's son in one regard, anyway."</DefaultText>
