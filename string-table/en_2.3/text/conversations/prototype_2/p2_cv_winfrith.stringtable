      <DefaultText>A portly, smiling man stands behind a warped wooden counter, polishing a buckler. He looks up. "Haven't seen you before. Always glad to see a new face in town. Company's good for business and chatter's good for the soul, that's what I always say. Anyhow, what can I do for you?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He shakes his head and clucks. "That's the problem with these lords. They think their money and their family name entitle them to some kind of special treatment. They expect everyone to fawn over them the way their servants do. No, sir. That's not the kind of people we are, not in the Dyrwood. We broke away from Aedyr to get away from that kind of nonsense. If they think..."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Of course, of course, I was just getting to her." He clears his throat. "I haven't seen her. Not since she went missing, anyway."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"An alchemist. Runs a small stand near the center of town. Talented lady, but she had a run-in with some wurms not long ago. She's lucky it wasn't that ogre that's been roaming about. It took all of Rumbald's pigs the other day, did you hear? But don't get him started. He's still sore about the subject, and once you get him wound up about that ogre and his pigs, he just won't stop talking..."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Well, like I told you, and like I told those soldiers, that's not how we do things out here. The last man who tried to boss us around was an emperor, and we told him right where he could shove it, if you'll pardon the expression."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Oh, we're a quiet little town, not much happens here. 'Specially not since the Legacy hit. People realized they couldn't have babies and just stopped trying altogether. And that takes a lot of the excitement out of the day-to-day, if you can believe it."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"That lord's got you asking around, too, eh?" He grunts. "At least you ask politely enough. Bad enough having a small army move into town, but then they start throwing their weight around and telling you your business." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"She mostly kept to herself." He shrugs and wipes at the buckler again. "But you know how women are. Always carrying on, full of palaver once you get any two of them together. Perfectly harmless, mind you, I'm not criticizing. Just feels like they never run out of things to say. That girl seemed rather quiet, downright shy if I do say so, but even Hendyna got her talking. Just goes to show you."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He points at you, his hand shaking with excitement and emotion. "There! That's the kind of attitude I'm talking about! You stroll into this village, no respect for other people, and just expect them to jump on your command because you say so."</DefaultText>
