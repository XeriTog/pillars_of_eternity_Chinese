      <DefaultText>He scratches his head. "Could be a lot of things. The locals here don't seem to realize Hadret's Rebellion ended one hundred fifty years ago. Crowing about the castle they tore down and built their village over. I wouldn't put something like this past them."

      <DefaultText>"Who wouldn't be? The whole village smells like wet leather and pig shit, and the locals have nothing but contempt for anyone who bathes more than once a year."

He shakes his head. "They won't lift a finger to find Lady Aelys, but it raises their hackles when we go looking for her."</DefaultText>
