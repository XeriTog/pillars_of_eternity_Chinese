"Pretty sure you won't find one among them who stood within a hundred miles of that bridge when the Godhammer went off.

      <DefaultText>"Was twelve Dyrwoodans, stood outside Halgot Citadel waiting for Waidwen to cross the bridge there. They had to hold him there long enough for the Godhammer to detonate, so that's what they did."</DefaultText>

"The Dozens, they like to take things into their own hands. Gets ugly sometimes. We don't have 'em in Gilded Vale, but they'd be right at home there."

      <DefaultText>"I knew some soldiers who got recruited by the Knights after the war was over. They told me some about it.

"They get these young kids in there and they tell them about blacksmithing and about the revolution and about tradition. Talk about the Golem like he created the Crucible Knights in his forge to go win Dyrwood's independence."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Then they join, and it turns out all any of those Knights ever talks about is when are we gonna get recognized as a real knighthood? When are we getting our titles and our land?

"Their High Justice wants to be an erl. Says it's Abydon's will. He's got a castle and an army. You wonder how long he'll wait before he starts a war over it, saying Abydon told him to."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Ed&#233;r is quiet for a moment.

"By the time I'd cooled off, months had passed. One morning it dawns on me that my brother always knew better than me, and if he was so sure of what he was doing then I should be there with him. I packed my things and was on the road that same morning.
