Oddly enough, it feels like she's not speaking to you... it feels like she's speaking to an audience. The air takes on a curious edge, a chill, which persists for a sharp moment... then fades into a dull fear.

The chimes are finely crafted, of white adra. They are wrapped around the Grieving Mother's wrists with tiny woven braids of hair of different colors, from white to black, brown to blonde. You feel as if you're noticing them for the first time.</DefaultText>
