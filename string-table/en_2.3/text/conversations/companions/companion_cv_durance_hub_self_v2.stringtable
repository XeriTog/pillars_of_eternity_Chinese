      <DefaultText>Durance snorts. "What does a 'Watcher' mean? Durance is something sacred of Magran... one of her memories, perhaps, a branch of teaching." He taps his staff slightly, as if remembering, then shrugs.

"Let us not waste time talking of it. We have not shared the road and fire long enough, and this teaching of Durance... well, Durance is not a popular chapter of the faith."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"The why of it is you're a Watcher." He snorts. "A Watcher runs two roads of 'why.' For me, it's more a matter of what.

"There was a time when I wouldn't have spared a thought for your words. Or even bothered with you... but now, seeking out Watchers is what I do, to put the truth to them, see which of the two ways they bend." He smiles slightly, taunting.</DefaultText>

"Not many can see it at first, nor the etchings or the flames, but your eyes..." He stares at you, almost eagerly, nodding. "...your eyes traced the path. That I could see."</DefaultText>

"This land needs life again, new seeds planted in the burned soil." His voice drops, mocking, and his eyes narrow. "And something tells me you can see the path to making that future happen, Watcher. Your kind always does."</DefaultText>

His smile widens, and his hands tap against his waist, once, then twice. "And when you knock one truth against the leg of another, why, both legs stand firm."

"But now, if you strike a lie at the knee with the same force..." His smile dies, and his eyes narrow. "...why, you make a cripple with but one leg to stand on."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Durance?" Durance glances at you, is about to shrug - then takes a second look, frowns. "Hm. We've shared the fire and a difficult road enough - enough to know you're willing to suffer one and walk the other.

"Every god who has followers has a chapter solely for them, whether they know it or not." Durance frowns. "I know it."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"This chapter is not a thing of intent, but a flame that catches you. Everyone hears dogma and hymns and rituals in a different way, and whether they admit it or not, the fires that catch your senses all weave into a larger bonfire, which becomes your religion. Your way of life. Your road.

"Worshipers take what they want from the god, and then translate it... so it was with Durance. Was a man once, before he became the religion."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Durance, a saint?" Durance laughs. "No, he worked for a living."

      <ID>57</ID>
      <DefaultText>"No, no saint in his teachings. His disciples did much of the work, like soldiers heading out to war." Durance sneers. "His teachings are... 'impolitic'... now. It was composed of several trials and lessons, woven together for the sake of faith"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Durance's face wrinkles in a frown and he taps the staff in his hand. "There is no scripture, no poetry or wordplay open to interpretation. Its disciples are often not welcome, so they walk the road... a physical devotion." Durance grunts. "Many a metaphor has killed a man, when it would have been best to show him the truth of it, as ugly as it may seem.

"Before Durance, I put my faith in a great many such words, and encouraged others to do the same. All were weaker for it. Unworthy of the flame."</DefaultText>

      <ID>60</ID>
      <DefaultText>Durance's face darkens. "The devotions are from days when Magran would not simply open her legs for any eager young initiate. 

"Instead, she would turn away these 'faithful,' and ask them to wander the land to prove themselves devout."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>61</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Based on the trials and judgments, then access to the god is... granted. But it was up to each initiate to find the fire within them and that fire..." 

Durance frowns. "That fire rarely burned when first they came to Magran's door and sought acceptance... begging is not what transforms one. But to say such now... the words are not welcomed as they should."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"The reasons are so many you would age and die listening to them all." Durance's eyes narrow, as if staring into the distance. "But the teachings of Durance also included casting established clergy out who might need reminders of such devotion as well."</DefaultText>

      <ID>68</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Those are trials that few can bear to let go once the... comforts... have taken them." He frowns, his eyes darkening. "They see the trials of Durance as... unnecessary for the continuation of the faith. 'Inconvenient,' sometimes. They hold fast that there are other ways to spread Magran's fire without leaving marks as Durance taught."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"As the disciples walked the road, the trials of Durance they suffered - and dispensed - were also ones of justice.

      <DefaultText>Durance is silent for a moment, studying you.

    <Entry>
      <ID>161</ID>
      <DefaultText>Durance shrugs. "The cut of the cloth rarely matters except to a tailor, and colors are better found on banners than worn on the shoulders."

"I wore these on our pilgrimage to Halgot - as well as after." He glances at them. "We were to travel quietly, so few would know our religion. Or intent. Like executioners, with robes instead of hoods."</DefaultText>

"Imagine a campfire - then a field of them." His hand cradles his staff. "Then form them into a sphere, and let it grow until it fills the air." He swallows, his throat dry. "Its violence ran through my stave and my spirit like a hundred lightnings, and all around me... was flame."</DefaultText>

"Either way, she answers my call, quietly or loudly, but her colors seem weak in comparison to the acts one does in her name.

"The fiercest of us... well, we took the battle to Eothas... and Readceras... it took strength to turn back their heresies, and I doubt many of Magran's highest could have done the same."

"Then the teachings dwindled, died... as most flames do." Durance stares at his staff. "But they still leave marks."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Where I hail from?" Durance sighs, his hand tightening on the staff for a moment, then relaxes. "From one of Magran's fires... a cathedral, Ashfall, made of blackened trees."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I studied the scriptures there, the fires carved into the land, the trunks of the burnt trees, and in the factories where the rifles and cartridges were shaped. All are chapels in - other devotions."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Durance nods. "For Magran, any fire is enough for worship, physical or not. A blacksmith's anvil, a craftsman's bench, all arenas where fire is waiting to be born..."

Durance snaps his finger. "It just needs a spark. Like an alchemical fire... or a spark to cartridges, to speed them to their purpose."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Durance tilts his head, thinking. "Well, their purpose THEN. It was many thens ago." Durance scratches his beard. "Beard was a little brighter than now."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"But yes, cartridges, guns all had a purpose, and that purpose was punching holes in mages like you and letting their pompous air hiss out."

Durance gives a half-smile, then a nod. "Woke your kind right up and kept them staring at the ceiling in the dark instead of sleeping, that's for certain."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Durance nods again. "Mages were troublesome in that time... firearms made every man a mage, and a caster's pretty arcane shield was little match for them. 

"It turned each commoner into a beast that could spit fire. It leveled the field of battle, that's for certain, made many a mage a grave."</DefaultText>
