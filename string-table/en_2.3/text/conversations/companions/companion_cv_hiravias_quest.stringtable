      <DefaultText>Hiravias skims over the Glanfathan script, clears his throat, and reads aloud.

"Is not the water sacrificed unto the plant? And the plant sacrificed unto livestock? And livestock unto man?

"When the lesser soul is sacrificed to strengthen the greater soul, the whole of our family grows stronger."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He look at you with a furrowed brow. "I suppose I get the argument - we all have to kill and eat, constantly for that matter, to live. This sounds like it's talking about the Blood Sands rituals - I wonder how, or even if, this is relevant to me."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Hiravias stares at you with a smile. "A fair point. Wael wanted me to see this so... what about it applies to me?"

His voice sinks and his face turns pale. "Am I the lesser soul? Was being cast out of my tribe the sacrifice that made the greater soul stronger?"

      <DefaultText>"I don't know, just sounds like they're trying to justify their practices of killing people.

"Come on, let's see what the other tablets have to say."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He bites his lip and falls silent for a moment.

"So the other tablets spoke of the Stelgaer judging - reuniting. And that other one spoke of recombining souls that split over the ages.

"I guess... I'm supposed to use my power to sacrifice others or... BE sacrificed? Not sure I like the sound of either."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>His good ear stiffens while his mangled ear twitches and shakes.

"It hadn't occurred to me but... I did win the fight. If Galawain were truly displeased with me, I can't imagine I'd have walked away from that trial alive."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Each generation," Hiravias reads from the Glanfathan text, "the anamfath must stand before the Autumnal beast in judgment."

Hiravias coughs uncomfortably and continues, "The wise endure, passing on their strength. The weak are eaten - their souls ripped to pieces and lost for all time - removing such weakness from the cycle."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Well... I guess maybe my tribe wasn't entirely wrong about my spirit form being some sort of soul-terror. I suppose I was hoping to hear a different answer on the matter but..."

Hiravias shrugs, his arms slump to his sides.</DefaultText>

      <ID>14</ID>
      <DefaultText>"But it's worth asking - in all your times walking in the Autumn Stelgaer's fur, how many souls have YOU destroyed?"</DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>15</ID>
      <DefaultText>"That I'm aware of? None," he says, resolutely as his face turns red.

"I get what you're saying - I merely wear the form of the Autumn Stelgaer - it's not in control of me, nor the sum of who I am."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He lets out a long sigh and relaxes.

      <ID>20</ID>
      <DefaultText>"You could most certainly say that," Hiravias says with a smile.

"So, my tribe was right - the Autumn Stelgaer IS some sort of soul-destroying beast but I merely borrow the creature's form - not its reason for being."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Not exactly. I'm older, wiser, and stronger than when we last tussled, but um... I can't really afford to lose any more eyes or ears. I'm fresh out of redundant organs."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"If and when we make it to the Burial Isle, I'd like to explore the area. The tablets suggest that many have gone there to be murdered - sorry, judged - by the beast."

He clears his throat and gives you a nervous smile. "Not exactly dying to see it again, but Wael and Galawain both seem insistent on leading toward that event. So when you are ready, let's head to this Burial Isle."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"It's a notion that has always troubled me. Maybe eating souls is like fucking - I just meet the right person, instinct will take over, and I'll feel ashamed yet smug the following morning."</DefaultText>

      <ID>33</ID>
      <DefaultText>Hiravias' face squirms and he rocks his head side to side. "Well... yes... and no."

His fists ball up and he releases a long sigh. "Yeah, this puts a lot of things into perspective. If you take a step back from it, Galawain must be having a great laugh over how slow a study I am to learn his lessons."</DefaultText>

      <ID>36</ID>
      <DefaultText>Hiravias blinks at you several times. "Two things. First off: don't lecture me on Wael. Second: you're absolutely right."

His hands tug at his tunic. and he straightens his posture. "I should be excited by the act of learning, not faltering on my own expectations - Wael would want that."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>38</ID>
      <DefaultText>"That's..." Hiravias' intact ear stands up and a smile crosses his face. "That's a very good point. Why didn't I think of that?"

He runs his hands along the scars near his eye, his posture becomes alive with nervous thought.

"Maybe I've been thinking about this all wrong. I mean... I survived an encounter with the Autumn Stelgaer - plenty of anamfatha can't say the same."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>His face becomes a scowl and he aims his one eye at you. "If it meant not being ostracized, I'd have spiritshifted into a mound of weasel droppings!"

His anger subsides and he looks at you for a long moment as he attempts to put his words together.

"You make a... fine point. I did pray to Galawain for assistance in being a better hunter..."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"As souls split into multitudes," Hiravias says with dramatic gusto as he reads the Glanfathan runes from the tablet, "many lives come from one.

"The Truest of power comes from sacrificing the shard to return its strength to the mother stone."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>42</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Hmmm... The 'many lives from one' sounds familiar - I was taught that sometimes, between death and rebirth, a soul splits perfectly in two - creating two viable souls from one.

"Sounds strange, but it makes sense when you think about how the population has risen in generations. It's kind of a mathematical necessity that some process like this is happening."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>44</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I suppose..." Hiravias pauses and re-reads the tablet, his mouth silently wording the Glanfathan script.

"Well, I guess all of us - most of us - have a soul that has lived many lives and split at one or many points."</DefaultText>

      <ID>45</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I just can't shake the fear that I'm the 'shard' and my destiny is to be fed to something greater."

Hiravias stares at you, wide-eyed and silent for several moments.

"Guess worrying won't do me any good - let's read those other tablets."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>46</ID>
      <DefaultText>Hiravias looks at you pensively.

"So that one tablet talked about the Stelgaer culling the weak anamfath - and the other one suggesting that the beast can make things whole.

"Am I the mother stone or the shard in the allegory? Wael must be enjoying my confusion."</DefaultText>

      <ID>48</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Sorry sir, I'm not eating your soul, I'm merely serving a vital role in the natural process," Hiravias rolls his eye. "I see what you're getting at it, but it's not making me feel better."

"Fungus that grows on shit has an important role in the natural order - that wouldn't make me thrilled to spiritshift into a shit blossom."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"So why did Wael lead you to this tablet?"</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>50</ID>
      <DefaultText>Hiravias scratches at his ear stump as his gaze drags along the floor. "If that druid really wanted me to see this tablet... and if Wael really is guiding my quest for knowledge..."

"There's someone out there who has the same 'soul past' as me? So what? That's probably true of most of us."</DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>51</ID>
      <DefaultText>Hiravias clears his throat and reads the Glanfathan script on the tablet: "Upon Burial Isle, the two men meet again for the first time, though it was the last thing they did. The many-colored beast rent them both asunder. They were, in death, merged and made whole again."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>52</ID>
      <DefaultText>He looks at you and chuckles nervously. "Cute story - two guys 'meet' in the belly of a soul-eating creature. Maybe someday I'll eat two of the most insipid Dyrwoodan lumberjacks and they'll spend an eternity discussing beer whilst haunting my colon."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>

      <ID>53</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Perhaps the idea is that the Autumn Stelgaer might not really destroy the souls."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>54</ID>
      <DefaultText>"That could be true," Hiravias mutters, "But I guess I don't know what to make of this. I've never - knowingly, at least - eaten ANYONE'S soul... maybe it's a trick I've yet to learn. Lucky me!"</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>55</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Still, I have a hard time believing that me spiritshifting and mauling anyone is going to make anybody 'whole again' despite what this tablet says.

"I'd like to look at the other tablets and see what they have to say."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>56</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I mean, if you add what the other tablets were saying... about the Stelgaer judging the anamfatha and reuniting lesser souls and such..."

Hiravias folds his arms and looks at you pensively.

"Okay, the druid was right - I did need to read these tablets... too bad I'm still confused."</DefaultText>

      <ID>60</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Fine fine - you make a good point. I guess I've been mad about the details when, in fact, I was able to master the spiritshift after petitioning Galawain... just as I asked."

Hiravias runs his fingers along the scars that connect his missing eye to his missing ear. "I wanted be a better hunter... the greatest. There's probably some lesson here about tempering one's desires."</DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>61</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I know now that Galawain sent his emissary to maul me for a good reason - it wasn't strictly malice. And I was sort of hoping to find out that the soul eating talk was just rumors... alas..."

He smiles a nervous grin and shrugs. "Maybe I'll meet the prey Galawain wants me to hunt... or I'll find out I'm the quarry."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Hiravias pants and wheezes, his one good eye locked on Scathden's corpse. Blood and sweat drip down his fur, and he rocks back and forth on the balls of his feet, as though expecting the body to stand back up.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>64</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Amused, I suppose. Wael showed me that Galawain was answering my prayers - he made me the great hunter I wished to be. The mauling wasn't a punishment, just a very, very hard test."

Hiravias looks down at Scathden's body and smirks. "And I think Wael showed me just right now what I will become if I let this facet of my life be all-consuming."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />

      <ID>65</ID>
      <DefaultText>Hiravias slowly nods and smiles. "Excellent," he says after a long pause.

He paces several times around Scathden, his gait proud and relaxed. "I endured Galawain's trial, and vanquished my equal. The only thing I regret now are the years I wasted viewing this whole thing as a curse. The ostracism was, no doubt, just another way of Galawain forcing me to be stronger."</DefaultText>

      <ID>68</ID>
      <DefaultText>Hiravias nods. "Yes, I've had enough of Galawain's tests and trials. Even if I could best every other man that wears the Autumn Stelgaer mantle, what's the point? My heart isn't in the hunt like it used to be"

He looks at Scathden's mangled body and shakes his head. "Which is almost a shame, since I'm a pretty amazing, and modest, hunter. But to answer your question: yes, I'm done here."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>69</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Almost," he says as he kneels before Scathden's body, bows his head, and quietly chants.

You barely make out his solemn words: "We thank thee, Galawain, for guiding our hunt; for today we grow strong off the flesh of the weaker." 

He stands up, straights his tunic and smiles at you with a nod. "I think we're done here."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>As your eyes relax and your vision adjusts to the hum of the invisible, you see a swirling pile of red, orange, and yellow leaves. The cyclone of foliage flies apart, and the leaves drift off into parts unknown.

As Scathden's essence fades from view, you see a handful of autumn leaves circle about Hiravias as his soul glows a bolder shade of orange.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>As he starts to walk away, he abruptly whirls on his feet muttering: "Before the vultures get to him..."

He walks over to Scathden's corpse and places his hand in the dead man's mouth and tugs with all his might. Tendons and cartilage rip and tear with wet, gristly eruptions of blood until at last, the mandible is torn free.

"Figured I should take a reminder," he says with a blushing smile as he examines his blood-soaked trophy.</DefaultText>
