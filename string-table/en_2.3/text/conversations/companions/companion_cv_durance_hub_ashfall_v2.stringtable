      <DefaultText>"What more to tell." Durance frowns, his hand tightening on his staff again, his fingers seeming to sink into the wood. "It is one of the greatest fires of Magran, the high seat." He shrugs. "Some say the blackest... not of evil, but of ash, all that remains after fire has fed."

He pauses. "I called it a cathedral before. That's not the full truth of it."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"It's more a battlefield... it lies in the heart of the War of Black Trees, its timbers built from the burnt forest there, each timber blessed by fire, and one of Magran's greatest battles.

"Many of us helped shape the war effort there &#8211; with flames and firearms."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Well, now..." Durance scratches at a pox scar on his cheek, although his other hand remains tight on the staff. "Was many tens of years ago. Fire swept through the woods, a fiery harvest, a sign from Magran..."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Her fingers lay upon the scape there, like nail marks across a man's back." Durance's hand falls from his cheek and joins his other hand tight on the staff. "The forest has never regrown, no seed was laid beyond her sanctifying the ground.

"The blackened trees still remain, like black hands reaching from the ground." He chuckles. "It's more romantic than I make it, Watcher. It still bears a woman's touch, after all."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Massive. Beautiful. Blessed by the goddess, flame cannot strike it twice."

Durance's eyes travels to his ashen staff, studying the etchings. "Beneath? Tunnels and chambers, bellows and fire pits... and many of the faithful, looking for a means to bring fire to the world."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"This?" Durance blinks as if in surprise. "In a way. This..." He shrugs. "This is more of what's left behind when flame strikes.
 
"If Ashfall is a cathedral propped up and fenced with such sticks, then this stick, well - this is what props me up as I walk the cathedral of my road, to other Ashfalls waiting to be made, perhaps."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Tales, reminders. Something to think upon, devotions I can wrap my mind around when chanting words becomes tiresome." He grunts. "Chants lose their strength, but carving symbols into the wood with one's finger, blessed by fire..."</DefaultText>

      <ID>29</ID>
      <DefaultText>Durance takes his finger, and you watch it trace one of the paths along the wood, and the symbol glows slightly, red embers from a fire. As he draws his hand away, it still glows, and he stares at it, letting it reflect in his eyes.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I find symbols are a greater source of devotion than words, texts... if there were many texts to be had." He grunts, wrinkles his nose. "Texts remind me of Aedyr, the perfume of aristocracy."</DefaultText>

      <ID>31</ID>
      <DefaultText>He straightens his back and sighs, and his hand cradles the staff again. "The War of Black Trees and this staff I carry are the only hymns and devotions I need. And it's a symbol, one that the faithful and faithless alike understand."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Life is dangerous. You would know more than most." Durance grunts. "Flame is always hungry, and if you don't respect it, its kisses will fire your loins like a Defiance Bay copper-corner whore."

Durance closes his eyes for a moment, as if thinking back. "Some chambers were consumed, some destroyed, but Ashfall remains. Would be good to see it one day, if I return." He shrugs. "I doubt I shall."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Durance's eyes open and he glares at you. "Because home is a mess of disappointments, that's why... never make a place your home, Watcher, that's my advice to you - keep to the road. A home is a curse - it'll kill you to stay..."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You notice Ed&#233;r's been listening. He speaks under his breath.

"Don't know if the problem is so much a cathedral in his head as bats in his bell tower..."

"Sure am sad, though, that I missed the party they must've thrown, soon as he'd left. Now THAT'S a disappointment."</DefaultText>

      <ID>38</ID>
      <DefaultText>"...and the moment your foot exits its door? It'll never again measure up to the cathedral in your head." Durance grunts, his hand tightening on his staff. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I'd expect you to understand, Watcher - you don't seem to value whatever home you are from, either, and you are likely a stronger person for it."</DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>42</ID>
      <DefaultText>"So if you ask the why of it, Watcher, the why that one doesn't need a cathedral to uphold the faith or remind one of it. I don't hate it, I don't despise it, I'm not some weeping cast-out fool - I wander because of my faith and to spread it." He grunts. "And I have many tens of years to go before Durance's trials let me go."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"And I'll never get there while I'm bantering words with you... but then who's more the fool - the fool who asks, or the one who answers?" He snorts. "I tire of your word play, let's do something."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Durance glances at you warily, his eyes studying yours. 

After a moment, he shakes his head and frowns, irritated. "I don't seek converts, nor teach the faith... let's just keep our walks and talks simple. Besides, we have not shared the road and the fire long enough to even make such a talk worth either of our times."</DefaultText>

      <ID>48</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Oh, truly." Durance frowns, then wrinkles his lips in disdain. "If you're more than curious, then take what little warmth and comfort in being able to see the symbols..." He frowns. "That alone is enough for your eyes now, Watcher."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />

      <DefaultText>Durance glances at you in irritation - he seems about to snap at you, then stops, frowns. He glances at the staff, then turns it in his hands... as he does, there is the hint of embers, symbols glowing on its surface.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"The most devout of Magran's knees bend there, yes." He snorts. "Its halls are more cramped and unpleasant than Woedica's burned cunt."

He turns the staff in his hands. "But... in truth, the wood's from the forest, the War of Black Trees. More honest than any sticks propped up by men. Felt Magran's heat a little brighter, rather than Ashfall itself."</DefaultText>

      <ID>61</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Carved?" Durance scoffs, then his voice settles with an almost proud strength. "This staff is a history. Acts leave their mark. Some symbols fall into the ash, others blaze brighter."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"They are energies of the spirit, a channel for one's faith." He frowns. "It's hard to say. There was a time when they glowed brighter, but now... they are an aid in my work."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Memory. Meaning." He snorts, seemingly at himself. "It's same as the memories in your head, perhaps more trustworthy.

"Random acts, things done with instinct... they may make lines, burning briefly through the wood. Acts devised, planned, that stay with you... symbols form, and tell the story."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>65</ID>
      <DefaultText>"It's like all memories, except the staff burns it true. When a thought's close, you see it clearer, brighter... ones you forget... they get buried. But like rings in wood... the etchings remain." He grunts. "Keeps me grounded." His face relaxes into a grin. "Also, it's a solid walking stick."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>66</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Because the staff's markings stand out to a Watcher... well, they sometimes identify themselves." He frowns. "And sometimes, they're blinded to the staff as well. A gift of Magran, perhaps, to cloak itself from sight when one isn't looking for it."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"The twelve circles are a sign of the dozen on the bridge, and the dozen of us that let the hammer fall on them, bridge, god, and all.

"If there's a symbol that is unlikely ever to fade... it's that one. I thought it might be the last the staff I would ever hold. Was holding it that day on the bridge when Eothas fell." He frowns, his eyes frozen on the staff. "It was the spark put to the Godhammer. Might be the last light that touched Eothas before the pyre ate him."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Durance frowns. "It is... there, but marked different. 

"I follow Durance, and in his teachings, there is but a single flame - a simpler aspect." His frown deepens, and he taps the edge of the staff. "Durance would meditate by focusing on a single flame, and attach meaning to it. It was something to center the spirit for what was to come."</DefaultText>
