Kana pauses. "Well, up here this is all Aedyran, of course, but should we descend far enough, we will find some real history!" </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"He was in possession of the Tanvii ora Toha - or whatever form of it preceded the one we know.

      <DefaultText>"There are those who say that we haven't held to its instruction.

      <DefaultText>"If I can find the original, I can prove it. They'll know that the chant is far older than we believed. That the Engwithans favored peace, and the trade of knowledge. If we follow in their footsteps, we can make a kingdom just as grand and lasting as theirs." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"My brothers would have it so. But we don't need to isolate ourselves to make Rauatai great. I know there's more to the chant - it wasn't created out of sand and water a thousand years ago, but brought to Rauatai by the Engwithans. By a people that knew the value of alliances, and shared their knowledge with us. And with that knowledge, we made Rauatai what it is today."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"That one's easy enough - but there are many verses, and... many interpretations. I would keep to the one that leads us into greatness, rather than into war.

      <DefaultText>"Well, not entirely. How could I? It's a dead language, and hardly anyone has translated even a small fraction of it." 

"But what little I can, I have translated. By comparing the symbols in his work to what others have found, I pieced together a phrase from the Tanvii ora Toha. Clear as day. I even gave it to the keeper to check. But she was convinced I'd written it myself." </DefaultText>
