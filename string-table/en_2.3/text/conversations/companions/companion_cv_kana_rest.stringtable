      <DefaultText>"You know, there are accounts of Watchers in all of the regions I've visited. If the adventuring life doesn't work out for you, you could always read souls for coin. Give people advice. Tell them which family they're related to, and whom they should duel for past offenses." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"It can get a little overwhelming." </DefaultText>

      <ID>8</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Well, you needn't soften your words on my account, if it ever gets to be too much. We'll find the means to cure you, [Player Name]. You've my word on that." </DefaultText>

      <ID>9</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I'm sorry if I was a little tactless, before, about your being a Watcher. I didn't really understand what was involved. Is it hard, hearing the spirits all the time?" </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>

      <DefaultText>"Probably safer than fighting off beasts." Kana chuckles. "And you get just as much drama out of it." </DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>15</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Sorry. It seems I'm not very good at raising spirits." Kana winces. "That was unintentional." </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>16</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Well, that's... not quite the approach I was thinking of, but very true." </DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>42</ID>
      <DefaultText>Kana laughs. "You've got Rauatai written all over you. That's hardly a bad thing, mind." </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>43</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Fair point. I've been here a short time, myself, but the locals leave a strong impression, I find. The, ah, food, too." </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>44</ID>
      <DefaultText>"...Just a feeling I have. In the gut." Kana's mouth twitches. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Oh, nothing embarrassing. I have an ear for accents, and the people here are a, er, colorful lot." </DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>48</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I assume nobody has called you out for a scrap behind the barn yet, then." Kana gives you a lopsided grin. "Nor I. There's much fuss made of the Dyrwood temper, but so far they've largely loosed it on each other." </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>49</ID>
      <DefaultText>"You think? I'm surprised nobody's called you out for a scrap behind the barn yet. There's nothing a Dyrwoodan seems to love more than a chance to prove how much they hate Aedyrans." </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>50</ID>
      <DefaultText>"They're a rather refreshing bunch, otherwise, I think. I've whiled away an hour or two talking to the regulars in one tavern or another, and everyone from the merchant to the servant has an opinion to share." </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>51</ID>
      <DefaultText>"So you have met the locals?" Kana laughs. "I don't know that they're so bad. There's a lot of fuss made of the Dyrwood temper, but they seem to save it up largely for each other." </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>52</ID>
      <DefaultText>"That seems to be a constant, in these parts. If it isn't trouble with the Glanfathans, it's trouble amongst the Dyrwoodans themselves. I find it strange, that a people surrounded by enemies should tear at each other so." </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>53</ID>
      <DefaultText>"There's this work shanty I overheard the sailors singing from time to time. About a woman who gathers the names of the ones she loves - the crew, you see - and with them weaves each sailor a merry fate." </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>54</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Animancy seems to be the topic of the hour here. You've closer dealings with souls than I do - what do you think of it?" </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>55</ID>

      <DefaultText>"You're not as interested in the subject?" </DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>59</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Of course." Kana flourishes with a hand. "But in practical terms, you approve?" </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>60</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Oh, no, I find it fascinating. I don't think you can really study the Engwithans without delving into the techniques and research that animancers are pioneering today." </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>61</ID>
      <DefaultText>"It's all very organized, I find. Dosages and measurements. Whereas with the Engwithans, their gifts with adra and soul energy seem more like... art. The one is a star chart, and the other is a ballad sung by a lonely pilot." </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>62</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I do. By unlocking the secrets of the soul, we can realize our full potential." </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>63</ID>
      <DefaultText>"It is, isn't it? Afflictions of the soul, treated as one might a broken limb... Who knows - we may see the dawn of a golden age." </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>64</ID>
      <DefaultText>"The animancers have bungled their research time and time again, and it's always innocent people who suffer for it."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>65</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Surely it's helped many people as well? Those suffering from soul-sickness, or else afflicted with temper and criminal impulse. Even the reading of soul lineages - people have a better sense of their place in the world."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>

      <DefaultText>"[Player Name]... Do you think a single man might change the course of destiny?" </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>71</ID>
      <DefaultText>Kana sighs. "There are people - yourself included - who seem to change the world around them just by passing through it." 

"And then there are those who maneuver and scheme, pulling strings from the shadows, and by that method topple ducs." </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />

      <DefaultText>"No. Things play out as the gods ordain. There's no helping it." </DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>78</ID>
      <DefaultText>"But... then might not a god work through you? If Thaos had not murdered the duc, then the riots might never have occurred. Do we play parts already written, or is it simply that we are tugged, inexorably, towards a destination?" </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Of course not! I only meant to say... I wonder if perhaps I've been going about this wrong." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"My apologies. Let's change the subject. ...Fine weather, isn't it?" </DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>89</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Hm. Nor does it seem to agree with Aloth, does it?" 

"Well, thanks for lending an ear. I look forward to seeing where this all goes." </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />

    <Entry>
      <ID>90</ID>
      <DefaultText>"There's something to be said for mystery, I suppose."

      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>95</ID>
      <DefaultText>"That makes the two of us. I've seen many examples of the good it might do - a cure for soul-sickness, and the reading of soul lineages... But with so many accidents - the Baelreach incident, for one - they've hardly made a good impression here in the Dyrwood." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Nobody deserves a rest more. You've done a great deal to help the people here." Kana sighs. "We'll find a solution. You've my word on that." </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>97</ID>
      <DefaultText>"A pity, since they seem to have a great deal of them." Kana laughs quietly. "Sorry. In any case, I'm sure we'll find a solution. You have my help until we do." </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>98</ID>
      <DefaultText>"You'd think they'd pick up on that after a while." Kana sighs. "Well, we'll find a solution. You have my help until we do." </DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>100</ID>
      <DefaultText>"There's no denying that the dead make for excellent sources of information, at times..." Kana coughs. "Sorry. At any rate, we're bound to find a solution for this. You can count on my help until we do." </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>101</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Hardly. You seem to be bearing up well, if you can jest at all hours. I'm glad for your wits - they've seen us through on more than one occasion." </DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>102</ID>
      <DefaultText>"You seem sane enough for our purposes." Kana grins. "And in any case, we'll find a solution long before Maerwald's curse sets in. You've my word on that." </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>103</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I imagine so. All the gathered dead, clamoring for attention." Kana coughs. "Sorry. At any rate, we're bound to find a solution. You can count on my help until we do." </DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>109</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Add a tune to that, and well - a man might stride singing into battle, no?" Kana chuckles. "In any case, your name, I think, holds power yet. You'll have to do your own weaving, however." </DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>112</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Interesting. I wonder if that speaks to your opinion of animancy or of kith. Ha - but I won't trouble you further. Let's be on our way." </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>113</ID>
      <DefaultText>"A fair stance. Well, I'm sure the Dyrwood won't let the matter lie. We're bound to go on hearing about it. Let's be on our way." </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>114</ID>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>115</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Hm. Perhaps with some regulations, then? Ah, but who would know enough to place adequate limits?" 

"Well, thanks for lending an ear. I look forward to seeing where this all goes." </DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>120</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Oh, idle conversation. But also because I've been thinking about the power of names. This man you chase - this Thaos. He takes an Engwithan name. I wonder if there's some meaning to it." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Indeed. I'll have a few questions about the Leaden Key, as well. Oh, but you get the first shot at him, of course. Priorities." </DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>126</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Of course. Apologies. I didn't mean to make light of it. Far from it - perhaps if we understand our enemy, we will find him all the faster." </DefaultText>
