      <DefaultText>"A-an impostor! Some wizard named Nyrid. He came into my house, tied me up in here. T-tortured me... And now, now he and his men are eating my food, breaking my things, selling svef - inside my own house!" He blinks.</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>71</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I know, and I can't force you to keep this secret, I just don't want to lose her. After what happened here, I'm sure she won't have anything to do with svef. Or me, if she finds out." </DefaultText>
