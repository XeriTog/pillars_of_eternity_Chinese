      <DefaultText>As you approach the dead man, you can feel the faint traces of his soul lingering, a stunned uncertainty holding it in place.

When you near, without warning, the soul hurries toward you, as though you were a solitary light in the dank gloam of this place come to usher it away. Its essence invades your consciousness.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Ahead is another figure dressed like you, traveling in the same direction. You don't know his name, and that's how it's supposed to be.

Out of the darkness, something monstrous grabs the other figure. You turn to flee but find yourself face-to-face with a troll. The panic pounding through your brain is interrupted by razor-edged teeth and claws.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You are in a different body now, walking deeper into the catacombs, cloaked in a dark robe with a mask pulled over your face. You're following a familiar path along the canal, heading to a room built around a statue of a figure wearing a robe much like yours. Others await, clothed in hoods and shadows.</DefaultText>
