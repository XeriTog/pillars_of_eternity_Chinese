      <DefaultText>Wenan's expression becomes serious, the timbre of his voice deepening. "Good men and women trying to walk in the footsteps of great men and women who came before us.

      <DefaultText>"The Crucible Knights take pride in having won the Dyrwood's freedom a hundred and fifty years ago, but we're the ones who've protected it.

"Everyone knows that the Saint's War ended when the Godhammer destroyed Waidwen at Evon Dewr Bridge. A lot of folks don't know how Waidwen wound up on that bridge."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"If there's anything that can stand a chance against this madness, it's weapons made by the Engwithans themselves. They made the same kinds of abominations in their time. They'd know how to kill 'em.

"I've sent the Giantslayers after the weapons, but they haven't had much luck so far. They're better fighters than treasure-hunters. Meet up with them at Woodend Plains and see how far they've gotten. If you can get those weapons, I'll see you get your cut."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He looks you clear in the eye. "Might be I sent them your way. Needed them to turn their attention away from the city for a while. Now they'll be doubling and tripling those patrols."

"There's a reckoning coming when these hearings end. Folks have had it with the Legacy. They've had it with soul butchers angering the gods. If the duc won't stop them, I'll be the Effigy if the good people of Dyrwood don't see to it ourselves. And the Dozens'll lead the charge."

      <DefaultText>Scars cover Wenan's arms, and he sports a purpling eye. But the grin on his face is nothing short of triumphant.

"Finally, we all see what those animancers and their lackeys in the Crucible Keep are really up to. It was only a matter of time."</DefaultText>

As for the Doemenels, I can't tell what they're up to. Probably taking coin from the Knights to keep this whole farce going."</DefaultText>
