      <DefaultText>As you approach, she eagerly turns to you. "You interested in doing some construction work?" Her clothes are simple but nicer than most you've seen in Ondra's Gift. "Pays good money."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"You mean... it was true?" She gapes. "That place really was haunted? I was sure those laborers were just trying to drive my price up.

"At least I can finally start building. Here, take this. For your help. And stop by some time - I've got big plans for this place."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Workers who aren't superstitious cowards, anyway." She shakes her head. "I offer good coin, but as soon as I tell them about the job, they say an oath to the Lady of Lament and spit over the dock.

      <DefaultText>"An inn. Allegedly." She brushes a single loose strand of her bun behind her ear. "The Gift needs a spot with a little more... class than the Salty Mast.

"This district has been in the dumps since the War of Defiance. It seemed ready for some fresh development. So imagine my excitement when I find this place - three floors tall and right on the water - for sale at a reasonable price."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Niah points to a ship anchored in the distance. "That's her. When she's at port, her captain, an elf named Maerwith, takes her shore leave over at the Charred Barrel in Brackenbury. Believe it or not, she likes her creature comforts."

She shakes her head. "That's what I'm talking about. When a pirate won't even set foot in the tavern on this side of town, it is high time for a new establishment."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Back at the end of the War of Defiance. It was one of the finishing blows to the Aedyran military.

"Cost us a lot, though. The whole district was supposed to be evacuated, but not everyone left in time. The Aedyrans put anyone they found to the sword. The lucky ones who escaped the slaughter drowned hours later when Hadret's forces broke the dams."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"The seller suggested that there were other interested buyers, so I closed the deal before I'd taken time to really look into it. Stupid." She shakes her head.

"Being from New Heomar, I knew about the floods, but I didn't know about the superstitions surrounding the lighthouse. And the seller was long gone by the time I found out.

"At this point, it'll be a miracle from the Lady of Lament herself if I make my investment back."</DefaultText>

"I'm from New Heomar, on the northern coast. It's smaller than Defiance Bay, so I came here hoping for some fresh opportunities. And maybe the chance to do a little good in this neighborhood."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"You'll never guess what happened!" Niah points to the lighthouse. "I was keeping an eye out for you, and who strolls down the dock but Maerwith herself. You should have seen the stares she got! But she walks right into the lighthouse, never a word to anyone. And just when I'm sure she's met some awful fate in there, she strolls right out, still saying nothing to nobody."</DefaultText>
