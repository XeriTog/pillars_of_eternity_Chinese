      <DefaultText>As you enter the room, you see several figures huddled together. They stand at attention - armed, but not in matched gear like the Crucible Knights. At the center of the group, one woman looms over another, holding a flail. She snarls at the cowering figure.

At a nudge from one of her men, the woman turns and sees you watching.

Her eyes narrow. "You shouldn't be here."</DefaultText>
