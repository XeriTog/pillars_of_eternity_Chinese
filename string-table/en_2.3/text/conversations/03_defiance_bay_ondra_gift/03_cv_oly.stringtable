      <DefaultText>The man is at a table by himself, but he constantly glances at the opposite bench as if waiting for someone. He reeks of alcohol, and he moves with the torpor of someone who's gotten used to spending most of his time drunk.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Whoa, whoa! Calm down!" He tries to push you away, but his movements are sluggish and imprecise. "Just don't hold me like that. Makes the room spin."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Oly finishes his drink and drums his fingers on the empty mug. "My throat's feeling mighty dry. If you want to talk, that'll be 10 pands for a refill."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>A sly smile stretches across his face. "A real fancy lady. Name's Lumdala." He taps his head. "I don't remember much these days, but I remember her. Usually, you have to pay a month's copper to spend time with a woman like that. But Lumdala..." He shakes his head. "She was falling all over Lendry that night. Left with him, too."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Right here, getting drinks with me." He slaps a spot on the bench. "Just like we have every night for the last five years. I couldn't actually tell you much about him, and I think he preferred it that way." He frowns at the rough wood grain of the table. "It's probably why we got on so well. Plenty of things we didn't talk about."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>A gruff laugh rattles his throat. "She said they were going on to see some frilly performance. If you ask me, they had their own plans to perform that night." He makes an obscene gesture and grins. "She just said they had to pick something up at her house in Copperlane first, some cozy little place by the northern gate." He picks up his cup. "Even a drunk like me knows what that means."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Oly nods. "Right. Let me know if you find him, yeah? Because that bastard owes me a round if he's found the good life." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Well, if that don't just..." His hand tightens around his cup, and he looks away. "I told that clod to enjoy the simple life. But he got these high-minded ideas, couldn't stop thinking about how things might be different..."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Anyway, I remember that night because he said things were finally turning around. He was going to find a steady job, clean up, have another crack at the respectable life. I told him in that case, he could buy the drinks." He traces the rim of his cup. "That's when she showed up."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"He spent most of his time here, drinking with me. Tells you enough, doesn't it?" He takes a gulp of his drink and shrugs. "He didn't volunteer details, and I didn't ask. But he had a working man's hands and a working man's taste for drink."</DefaultText>
