      <DefaultText>Vianna's face is covered in bruises, and her eyes are wide with shock and relief. "I-I don't know who you are, but th-thank you." Rapid, hitching breaths punctuate her words. "I was sure they were going to kill me." She wipes a tear from her cheek, wincing as her knuckle grazes a bruise.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Vianna smiles brightly. She bears a scar across her lower lip, but otherwise, she seems to be recovering from her ordeal. "Hello again. What can I do for you?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She gnaws on a split lip. "Commander Clyver of the Crucible Knights is waiting on my research. Not that you haven't already done a lot for me, but maybe you could take it to him? I'd kept it with me to prevent it from falling into the wrong hands, but you can see how well that worked out." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I thought I was coming here to meet my... um, 'friend' from the Republics. It looks like I walked into a trap."

She shakes her head. "The Dozens must have been watching me for a while. I'd been working on a special project for the Crucible Knights, and they weren't exactly subtle about contacting me."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"It deals with a rather rare branch of animancy. No offense, but I probably shouldn't get too specific without Commander Clyver's permission. He commissioned it, after all."

She laughs nervously. "And you can see the trouble a little indiscretion has gotten me into."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I studied animancy in Ozia, back in the Vailian Republics. I came to Defiance Bay to research local advances, but instead of going to Brackenbury Sanitarium, I found a position as a scrivener at the Temple of Wael. I've had access to many rare manuscripts that most animancers never see." She shrugs. "Of course, I've had to keep my head down. I've been careful not to let the head librarian - or my colleagues - know what I'm working on."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She nods at Dodwyna's corpse. "She took it from me when I arrived." She takes a deep breath. "Anyhow, don't wait on me. I can make my own way out of here."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Shh!" Vianna holds a finger to your lips and looks around. "Not so loudly. I don't really want word of my, uh, side projects to get around."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She glances toward the hallway and lowers her voice before continuing. "I've read a lot about how the Engwithans used to make animats. Ancient creations of stone and metal infused with whole souls. Tricky process, but I think I found a way to replicate it. That's what I told Commander Clyver, anyway."</DefaultText>
