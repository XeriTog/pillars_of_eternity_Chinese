      <DefaultText>An elven woman stands beside a stag, petting the great beast on its neck. As you approach, the animal jerks its head in your direction and rears up.

"Stillness!" the woman orders the stag, pulling on the skin of the stag's neck until it ceases to buck. "Easy now... no need to fight... yet."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The woman stands next to the great stag, petting its thick neck. She turns her head in your direction and gives you a nod of approval. "We witnessed the assault. You would make a strong huntmaster." Leaving the animal behind, she walks toward you.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"You should not be here, estramor." her hand moves to one of several blades strapped to her hips. "If you are here in our lands, it is either to steal from us or to aid those who would."

She gestures to the north, at the ruins of Engwithan buildings protruding from the underbrush. "Dyrwoodan mercenaries. Looters. Can you hear their panicked whispers? Leave this place at once, or we will kill you when we finish with these estramorwn."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The elven woman sheathes her sword and reaches to her stag. The animal lowers its head to meet the caresses of her hand. "Gentle. Strong. We wait here to welcome you back as warrior and friend."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Raiders. Looters. Same as all the other Dyrwoodan thieves that pillage our lands." The woman touches the oblique stub where half of her ear used to be. 

"We tracked the Dyrwoodans from their first step beyond the great river, and waited for them to err. They always do. We claimed half their pack in our first assault. The cowards that ran now huddle to the north - when the wind turns, you will smell their fear."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Objects can be lost or broken, knowledge never loses its value."

She steps in close and presses her hands to your navel, pushing on your center of balance. "When you spar with as many orlans as I do, you learn the hard way to be mindful of where you place your legs in a fight, and mindful of how easily your foe can shatter your control."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She frowns, looking at you wordlessly for several seconds.

"Hmph... I was expecting something different. No matter." She reaches into her pack, pulls out a leather satchel, and hands it to you.

"Love of treasure is like a path down the mountain. Easy to follow, and easy to fall. Just look at the looters."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The woman holds her gaze on you, then extends her hand to the side. The great stag approaches her, and the huntress gently pets its forehead.

"A deed without praise often sows resentment." She shrugs. "Should you decide that pride is not reward enough, seek me within Galawain's Maw, in Oldsong."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She turns to face you. One ear is missing its top half, and many battle scars raze her otherwise smooth skin.

"More foreigners. More unclean feet trampling on our lands. More blood to feed the trees." She shakes her head.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She holds her gaze on you. The great stag stomps its front hooves on the ground and turns to its master. "Do you speak the truth, foreigner?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"If you are indeed a friend, you would respect our lands and not defile our sacred soil with your trespass." The woman clenches her jaw. Its muscles quiver under the pressure until, suddenly, calm returns to her expression.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"If you have no bonds of kin or kith with the looters, I will give you a chance to prove it."
 
She draws one of her swords and with a swift arching motion points it to the ruins beyond. "The invaders must be purged from our lands. Prove your worth and we will believe your words."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Dyrwoodan looters often split their number to cover more ground, to evade our patrols, or to strike from all sides. I am to believe you are here, at this moment, by dumb luck?" Her jaw clenches, the muscles quivering.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The woman runs a finger along her lower lip, looking at you through narrowed eyes. "I gave you an order. Accept it like a grown hunter or refuse it like a mewling child. But do not question my will."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"You...? If your claim is true..." She snaps her fingers at a slender elven man armed with a hunting bow, and gestures in the direction of the Engwithan ruins. The man gracefully jumps on a rock and surveys the ruins from afar. He turns to her and nods in affirmation.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Their greed knows no bounds. Their memory honors no history. What use have we of prisoners? What example do we set to others by letting them live?" She shakes her head. "Why would we forgive, again?"</DefaultText>

      <ID>32</ID>
      <DefaultText>The woman gazes north, her mouth a twisted scowl as she ponders your words. The great stag nudges her shoulder, and she reaches up to scratch the animal's chin. "Blood was spilled. And life sprouts from a soaked ground."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Because you soar where they crawl. The Fangs deserve better foes than these wounded animals. Send them home with grave warnings for their kin." </DefaultText>

      <ID>36</ID>
      <DefaultText>She looks at you with a cold glare, mutters a curse under her breath, and sheathes her blade. "We will let the raiders return headless. Their leader must pay for the crimes - only then may the rest go free."

She waves her hand northward. "Go, deliver my message before I see the folly in this decision."</DefaultText>

      <ID>37</ID>
      <DefaultText>The stag arches its neck, aiming its rack of sharp horns in your direction. The huntress runs her finger along the beast's spined antler.

"Then you will die like any other trespasser." The woman whistles, and her hunting party attacks.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"You would steal my quarry? Deprive the Fangs of their hunt?" Her stern glare is quickly undone by her smile.

"Worry not estramor, we are pleased by your actions - even if you did deprive my younger warriors of much-needed practice. Forgive my earlier suspicion, you have shown your reverence to Eir Glanfath through your deeds."</DefaultText>

      <ID>39</ID>
      <DefaultText>"You have our gratitude, estramor. Though we could have dealt with the looters on our own, you spilled blood in our name. We honor such sacrifices."

She bows to you with a smile. "In glory of your assistance, and to offer you strength for your next hunt, I wish to share with you either our craft, our skill, or our bounty - whichever you feel is most worthy of you."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She looks among the Fangs and locks eyes with one of her warriors. She nods at him.

He, approaches you, and drops to one knee, and silently presents his weapon to you.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"It is rare for us to find new friends amongst the estramorwn. The Fangs will speak well of you, and we will await the day our paths cross once again."

She turns to her group and gives them a short command. The soldiers depart, the great stag quickly following after as the Fangs disappear into the dense cover of the Northweald's foliage.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Over a few hours of sparring, she shows you numerous agility and coordination exercises, and discusses at length the footwork she uses with every strike.
