      <DefaultText>He stops leaning against his sword and grips the pommel. "Wenan sent you..." A knot forms at his jaw.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The well-groomed man leans in, swaying as if drunk. "You think you can get the weapons? You've got two problems, rookie - a flooded entrance for one, and Crucible patrols for another. We've seen more Knights than face-painters out here."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Damned if I know. They're glorified thugs in armor and usually prefer their feathered beds to camp cots. I'd gut one in an instant, but I can't collect bounties as a wanted man."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Must be the rains." He shrugs. "We found this in the water, though." He holds up a flat, circular piece of adra and drops it into a pouch on his belt.</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>15</ID>
      <DefaultText>"That's an interesting question. You see, we never, ever, shares bounties." His companions move to stand in line with him, hands on their weapons.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Not much natural adra around here. Might be a key of some kind. Couldn't experiment much with the damn Knights prowling around."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I'll have words with Wenan, don't worry about that." He steps forward, his weapon now in hand. "You still shouldn't have come."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Of course you aren't. You traveled all the way here just to keep us company." He walks up to you, his face flushing with anger. "Don't lie to me again."</DefaultText>

      <ID>32</ID>
      <DefaultText>He looks at you, dumbfounded, for a moment before bursting into incredulous laughter. "I don't know where Wenan finds the likes of you."

"Sure, pup, we'll work together." He nods at his companions. "Just hold still and you can help my friends with target practice."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Byne locks eyes with you for an uncomfortably long time. He eventually breaks the stare, spitting a dark stream into the grass. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"You've got stones, I'll give you that... and you've caught me on a good day." He tosses you the adra disc. "Let's see you figure it out, then." 

He whistles. "Come on, hot meals for us tonight. We'll deal with these upstarts later."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Byne looks pleased, and his face is flushed with wine. He doesn't notice your hand snaking into his belt pouch as he steps away.

"Then we're done. I'm sure Wenan has other tasks better suited for one of your... mettle."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Byne's face flushes bright red. His hand inches toward his axe, but it finds the adra disc instead. He hurls it at your feet. "Then let's see you do better. Unless you're all talk, that is."

He turns to his companions. "Come on, hot meals for us tonight. We'll deal with these upstarts later."</DefaultText>
