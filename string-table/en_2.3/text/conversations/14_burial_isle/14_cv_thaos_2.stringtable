      <DefaultText>At your feet rests the body of Thaos, hollow, the dense wrinkles shaped by the silent shouldering of an eternal burden now smoothed across his color-drained face.

His soul remains still for the moment, defenseless, its energy expended in defeat. It lies sprawled across his body like a death shroud.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>With a deep breath, you plunge into Thaos' soul, and where in Brackenbury it had been a maze of narrow corridors and dead ends, now it is expansive and borderless, its walls crumbling into heaps like the ruins of Engwith as you pass through them.

You travel for what seems like ages, rushing to a known destination, a memory you glimpsed once before. At last you see it, no more than a pinprick of light at the end of a long tunnel, expanding slowly at first, then quickly as you near.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You come out in the room you are standing in now, but it is new and pristine and filled with people - thousands of them, all turned towards the great adra pillar and the machine that encases it. 

Thaos stands at the machine, and you are one with him now. You look out at the crowd, at faces of shriveled old men and cherub-cheeked little girls, at mothers bouncing infants to quiet them and fathers clasping their children's restless hands and watching you with somber acceptance. A woman with tears in her eyes gives you a small nod.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You turn back toward the machine, your breaths constricted beneath the weight of unwanted knowledge, preparing yourself to set out alone on a journey without end. You close your eyes and open them again to find the machine still in front of you, beckoning.

You take your place in front of it and place your hands upon a large mechanical disc at the base of the great crystal column and speak a single word. Giant rings creak to life, building speed, setting arrays of carved draconic mouths aglow and sending tremors through the platform beneath you.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The entire room shakes now with the force of the accelerating machine, all sound drowned out by its deep, deafening thrum. Brilliant tendrils of light arc outward from the pillar in all directions, and you look over your shoulder to see them engulfing the crowd, burning them brightly like hot iron. 

One by one, the tendrils disappear, leaving ashen effigies where people once stood, many of them disintegrating into gray heaps under the stress of the tremors.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You look above to the adra pillar, and a glowing spherical mass has begun to coalesce atop the column where the arcs converge. It grows and pulses, translucent and bulbous like some immense chrysalis, suspended in slow rotation as though it were being spun from the arcs of light.</DefaultText>

      <ID>10</ID>
      <DefaultText>When the last arc disappears, the spectral mass hangs a moment, no longer rotating, so bright you must shield your eyes with an outstretched hand, and it seems to you as though it is looking at you. 

You bow your head in acknowledgment, and look back up to see it melt into the pillar like warm candle wax. The pillar flares with a flash of light bright as the sun itself, then fades to darkness.

The machine slows down to an abrupt halt, and when the last echo of its grinding cogs has passed, the chamber is still, and you are alone.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Aloth shakes his head, looking down at Thaos in pity and wonder. "He spent lives - more than any of us will ever know - for what? Binding the world to a lie." 

He looks up at you. "Could a man like that ever be redeemed?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Hiravias stands over Thaos, arms folded, and gives the body a firm kick. "I hope this is the end but... what's to stop him from being born again with the same ill intent?"

He gives Thaos another kick. "And before you suggest the option, no - I'm not eating his soul. I'll put almost anything in my mouth... but not that."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You sense a listlessness to Thaos' soul, an overwhelming fatigue that hinders its immediate escape and makes it vulnerable to manipulation. You feel as though your victory has given you some kind of hold over it, and you are able to do with it as you please.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You can feel the pull of the intricate adra capillaries that rise up from the depths below the chamber. Many are bound up with the great pillar, and would pass to Woedica, but some are filled with the souls of the dead, bound for somewhere else entirely, and you know these are paths of rebirth.</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>50</ID>
      <DefaultText>You reach out for Thaos' soul, and you can feel its frailty in defeat, its texture like a coarse and threadbare cloth on the brink of disintegration. You insinuate yourself between the threads, pushing the weaving apart, unraveling the stitching until it is bereft of structure, a formless heap bound together by nothing at all.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>51</ID>
      <DefaultText>You regard Thaos' soul, still and subdued, and your pronouncement seems to empower your spirit. Your will seems to you now a thick chain, and you wind it around Thaos, constraining all movement, eliminating any possible last means of resistance.

    <Entry>
      <ID>52</ID>
      <DefaultText>You return to the landscape of Thaos' memory, to the vast terrain of deceptions and crippling despair, and you can feel your agency in this world now, an ability to reshape to the whims of your dominant will. 

You focus on a vision of pure emptiness, and your will becomes a swirling vortex around you, sweeping through the landscape and bearing away moments and lifetimes like some apocalyptic b&#238;a&#373;ac that would tear away the essence of the planet itself.</DefaultText>

      <ID>54</ID>
      <DefaultText>Stretching your presence as far as your spirit will allow, you make contact with one such path, and between it and yourself, you open up what feels like a long tunnel, sheer and undulating like the gullet of some enormous beast.

You shift your focus to Thaos' soul, clinging weakly to its vanquished shell, and with all your concentration you wrench it free and send it hurtling through the channel until it passes into the adra vein and can be felt no more.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />

    <Entry>
      <ID>55</ID>
      <DefaultText>In its midst you dedicate your focus to a single idea, and the idea is "shatter." 

You concentrate, and as you concentrate you feel a force building within your soul - an outward pressure that strains against containment, threatening to rupture your spirit. When you can contain it no more, you transfer it into Thaos' soul all at once and release it there, a detonation of will that expands in all directions, driving out the remnants of his essence, scattering it into nothingness.

You can feel his presence no more.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You call to mind the eternal prison, the vast empty cavern and its cells of adra, vacated by souls that chose to betray themselves in order to escape an infinite abyss of hopeless self-reflection.

You choose a vacant pillar, and pour your consciousness into it, creating a perfect, inescapable hollow with space for one. </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>57</ID>
      <DefaultText>And now you gather up Thaos' soul and bear it to the pillar like some bodiless jailer conjured by justice itself. You can feel its resistance now, the abject terror radiating from it, but your bindings will not be broken. 

When at last it is sealed away and you begin to recede back to your center, you could almost swear you hear a distant, wordless cry for mercy.</DefaultText>

      <ID>58</ID>
      <DefaultText>The storm builds until the very crust of the world peels from the fabric of the soul that anchored it, and it is borne off into the sky until it is too distant to observe. 

The last thing you see is a white void, boundless in all directions, unfettered by the shackles of experience and doubt.</DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>59</ID>
      <DefaultText>In the stillness that follows, a single word echoes through your mind - a word you spoke when you were one with Thaos in an ancient memory. You realize it is the word that activates the machine.</DefaultText>
