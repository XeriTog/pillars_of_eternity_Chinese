      <DefaultText>Standing next to you is a malnourished man clad in a threadbare loincloth and manacles. His entire body is striped with lash marks, and there are scarred pits where his nose and ears should be. He stinks of stale sweat and unwashed filth.

You notice someone wandering down the road, but the figure's back is to you. The scarred slave has your attention for now.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>His black eyes glitter. "I have observed you, Watcher. The way you handled that noble girl in Dyrford, delivering an idle Effigy to her uncle." He nods, his bald, scarred head shining. "A most careful scheme."</DefaultText>

      <ID>3</ID>
      <DefaultText>His black eyes glitter. "You know something of quiet servitude, Watcher. Groveling and simpering before the gods whose aid you need... so that when they finally raise you to a place of power, you can seize what you desire."</DefaultText>

      <ID>4</ID>
      <DefaultText>His black eyes glitter. "You know the bitterness of servitude, Watcher. The sting of the lash on your back and scalding rage in your chest as you watch your masters grow fat on your toils, oil and wine dribbling down their chins while blood runs from yours."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>His black eyes glitter. "I know your ways, Watcher. Scheming and plotting, an offer of friendship in one hand and a dagger in the other."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"You have labored at the pleasure of others - that shriveled hag in Hadret House, those preening soldiers with more taste for silk than steel, the wretched tribesmen playing out their fantasies of grandeur.

      <DefaultText>He sidles closer, a sly grin on his wrecked face. His stench is overwhelming. "And now the gods give you orders and commands. Even while you set out to fix what they cannot.

"Yet what have they offered you?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Skaen's voice becomes a hungry whisper. "Finish the work Thaos began. Strengthen Woedica with these souls and allow her to become the most powerful of all the gods... with you as her Favored."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The ragged hole in Skaen's face wrinkles with disgust. "Loyal and weak. Thaos proved his inadequacy when he failed to anticipate you. A plan exposed is worse than none at all.

"But you have proven resourceful. Equal to the schemes of gods. Woedica has a long memory, Watcher, for both friends and foes. And she keeps her oaths."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"The recipient of Woedica's blessings. She has always had a place for mortals of particular merit. If you help her now, she will become the most powerful of all the gods... and you will be the one who made her so. Think of the lifetimes of reward you would reap."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He rubs his hands together, his black eyes gleaming. "Safely hidden, yes. From the violent overlords who would cease to fear punishment in the next life. From the heavy-handed masters who would answer to no one. The world needs some schemes. Or are the souls of kith so pure that you would snap the tenuous threads that bind society?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Pallegina steps toward Skaen. "Equal parts madness and idiocy. Why would we form an alliance with one who has opposed us at every turn?"</DefaultText>

      <ID>19</ID>
      <DefaultText>Skaen turns his flinty eyes on Durance. "So says your companion who's been abandoned by his own god. Do you really trust him to make alliances for you?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Skaen takes a bundle at his feet and hefts the burden onto his back. "I've explained the alternative, Watcher. Continue as a pawn of the gods or a partner of one."

At the other end of the road, the figure stops. She turns her head just enough to look over her shoulder. Her face is mostly hidden, but one merciless eye peers at you from a cheek of rippled, scorched flesh.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He laughs. "You say that now. But when you're standing in front of the machine, considering the lifetimes and the powers that await you... we'll see what you do." He continues down the road, and when the sun suddenly drops below the horizon, it plunges you into momentary darkness. You come to your senses in front of the machine.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He laughs. "Yes, consider well the prosperous lives and the power that await you. I'm certain you'll choose well."

      <DefaultText>Skaen flashes you a grin filled with broken teeth. "And one you will have many lifetimes to relish. Remember it when you approach the machine."

He continues down the road, and when the sun plummets toward the horizon, it sears the road with a blinding, white-hot light.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Hiravias clears his throat and quietly says, "Five copper says he's about to sell you on his own agenda... only Wael knows what THAT might be..."

Hiravias grins and leans in closer, whispering. "If I were you, I'd tell him the other gods offered us a dozen nubile lasses - see if he can match that and haggle from there."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>As you approach the machine, the path underfoot suddenly changes to a cobbled road. If you hadn't experienced visions like this already in Teir Evron, you'd be tempted to believe that the machine had sucked you into it and deposited you in the middle of nowhere. 

The sun blazes overhead, and the rolling meadows and thick forests on either side of the road could be anywhere in the Dyrwood.

A shrill cackle turns your head.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>His black eyes glitter. "I have observed you, Watcher. You howl and rage against the powers above you, making wounds with your words in places your hands could never reach. You know the long, bitter struggle. The slow agony of a hopeless battle."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>His black eyes glitter. "You once grew fat while others spent the currency of their lives in your service. I would gladly rend your back with the lash, taking interest for every drop of blood you spilt, every scrap of flesh you scarred." 

He gives you a halting, exaggerated bow, glaring up at you even while his knees wobble and buckle. "But my mistress would appeal to your sense of perspective. For you know that all things have their place."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Your flesh burns and blackens, and scalding fluid fills your veins. You tear at your roasting skin, but peeling away the scorched layers does nothing to relieve your agony.

At last, the sun completes its descent, leaving you in darkness. When you come to your senses, you are in front of the machine, uninjured but filled with a new power.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"The Exiled Queen is not an ungrateful patron." 

You get a better look at the lone figure and realize that she's wearing robes, tattered and singed but fine nonetheless. On her head is the silhouette of a broken crown.

She continues walking, her pace slow but determined.</DefaultText>
