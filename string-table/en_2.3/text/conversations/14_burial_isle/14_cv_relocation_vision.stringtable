      <DefaultText>"That fort burned down a few years ago, when we cast the missionaries out. It was the missionaries who set fire to it. They didn't want us to be able to use it. Shame - there was history in that fort."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I don't think I can stay here any longer. I am told the Inquisition is gathering an army. That they have sent messengers to bargain with rulers from distant lands. Creitum is not built to withstand a siege."</DefaultText>
