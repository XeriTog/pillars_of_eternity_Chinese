      <DefaultText>"You are far from your post, Inquisitor. What brings you here?"

Your mind races, weighing different angles of approach, your emotions barely in check.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"We are in a sanctum holy to Woedica. There are others like it in service to the other gods. I come here often to pray for her counsel, and in this space I may be assured that she hears me."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Thaos' face remains a mask of impassivity. "What IS a god? Hm? A higher power? A rewarder of good deeds and punisher of the wicked? Something men can turn to in their darkest moments, when their days seem only like bridges from one tragedy to the next? Our gods are all these things."

With Thaos' every word you find yourself losing control of a boiling cauldron of rage and doubt and fear and hopelessness, until you can take it no more.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>With maddening calm, Thaos puts an index finger to his lips. "We are in a sacred place, within earshot of the gods themselves. This is not the time. 

"You have been through much these past few months."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"You will return home, and you will rest. When you feel you have recovered, you may rejoin us at the trials. The Inquisition is far from over, and I will have need of you."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"There are many who continue to spread the lies of the Apostate. The Inquisition will not end until we have pronounced judgment on ALL of them." 

His eyes linger on you, and there is no mistaking the threat behind it, and your rage shrinks at the image of an iron wheel in your mind, monolithic and caked with the dried blood of thousands. You do not ask your question again.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You've come to a circular room, grand and domed, its walls lined with adra and trimmed with copper. At the far end a great pillar of adra pierces the floor from below like a ragged spike, its shimmering texture giving the illusion of boundless depth.

Your thoughts are yours and not yours and they are all questions.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>At the base of the pillar stands Thaos, a look of concern on his face as he notes your approach.

You have something you want to ask him, one question above all others, spinning madly in your mind, but you don't dare ask it yet. You need some admission from him first, some hint of the veracity of your suspicions.</DefaultText>
