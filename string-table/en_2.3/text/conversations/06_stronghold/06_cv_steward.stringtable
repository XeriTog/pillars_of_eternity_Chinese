      <DefaultText>"Every effort to settle here has failed - from the time of our Aedyran colonists onward. Beasts rise from the Endless Paths, until the new lord or lady is no more. The one who dwells below, this... 'Master', does not tolerate rivals, it seems. I have seen, from time to time, intrepid explorers descend to lay claim to what answers they can... but none return.

"This is the force which has kept Caed Nua a barren ruin... and robbed me of my hopes."

      <DefaultText>As you come to the end of the great hall, you perceive an inviting warmth radiating from a grand throne wrought out of marble, its masterful artistry out of place amidst the castle's more practical stonework. The veiled face of a woman is carved above the throne's backing, watching over the room with hollow eyes.

At your approach, you feel the warmth fluctuate, as though stirring. A voice rings out from the carving, permeating the fortress through stone and air.</DefaultText>
