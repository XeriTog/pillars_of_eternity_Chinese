      <DefaultText>His phantasmal fist sails through your shoulder. "Don't worry, everyone remembers the raid was your idea. The r&#238;ow had to go along with it after you'd gotten the rest of the clan riled up. 

"No one wants it said that the Nine Claws were too cowardly to stand with the rest of the tribe when the foreigners desecrated our ruins."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The ghostly warrior gives you a long, covetous look. His semi-transparent eyes blaze as they crawl over you. "The tribes need more leaders like you. Women who value deeds over words."

      <DefaultText>He drops his hand to his side instead, drawing a notched blade from his belt. "You were right. We were too soft when the foreigners first came. And now they humiliate us.

"We'll be soft no more. And the invaders will learn to leave us alone once and for all."</DefaultText>
