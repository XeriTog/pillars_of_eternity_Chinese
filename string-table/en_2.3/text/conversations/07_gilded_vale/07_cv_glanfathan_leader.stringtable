      <DefaultText>A handful of dark figures stands above the fallen, treading on limbs and backs and heads, jerking their axes from bodies as if from half-split logs.

One of them, towering and severe with a thick beard tasseled with knots, holds a wet blade at the neck of the man you recognize as Heodan, the last of your caravan left standing.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He shoves Heodan toward you. As he does so, the man rakes his blade against Heodan's torso. Heodan screams and stumbles forward, a wide gash in his clothing beginning to bloom crimson.

The man sets his feet to engage you, his axe raised high.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Again, he hesitates. He looks off to the side, frowning, as if reevaluating his strategy.

      <DefaultText>The man frowns and motions as if to swing his axe. Heodan winces, but the blow never comes. 

Instead, the man cocks his head, intrigued. "Of course. But he would not. It is by the command of all the gods that we accept this charge."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I see. And what of Galawain's edict that weakness and age must be purged by youth and strength? You think Galawain would want some moldy, crumbling stones to survive long after their builders have turned to dust?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I'm sure he did. Just... not you personally. But why should that stop you from killing innocents?"</DefaultText>

      <ID>53</ID>
      <DefaultText>Distracted, the man's grip falters on his axe handle, and he nearly fumbles it, affording Heodan the moment he needs to dodge out of his swing, which comes too late. 

Howling with rage, the man charges you instead.</DefaultText>

      <ID>54</ID>
      <DefaultText>Your surprising speed catches the man off guard. He hurls Heodan out of the way in hopes of buying himself time to defend your charge.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The man drives his axe through Heodan's spine. The body gives one convulsive twitch before dropping at his feet, lifeless.

The man raises his axe high as he begins to charge.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Your enemy lies supine on the ground, unable to rise, his companions now silent among the other dead. His breath comes in wheezing, fitful gasps. He looks not at you, but at the sky above you.

"Forgive us."</DefaultText>

      <ID>59</ID>
      <DefaultText>Barely audible beneath his choked sighs, a whisper of wind stirs the air.

At this, the man's eyes roll back as he closes them. "Good. Good. The gods are just."

A queer smile crosses his face. "I am ready."</DefaultText>

      <ID>60</ID>
      <DefaultText>The wind begins to swell, whipping around the camp, electric and volatile, upending pots and rattling tents like an angry spirit.

You can feel it begin to seep beneath your skin, and where it pierces you it feels as though it is rending you apart from within.
