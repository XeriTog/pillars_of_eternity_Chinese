      <DefaultText>"I'm a trader. Originally from the Aedyr Empire, but I've been trying to establish new business out here."

He looks at his wagon and grins ruefully. "Life on the road has brought some unexpected challenges, to be sure. And I'm sure you've noticed how prickly the locals can be. But we're here to make the most of things, right?"</DefaultText>

      <ID>22</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Because it seemed friendlier than Readceras?" He laughs. "My brothers took over the family mercantile business a few years ago, and there wasn't enough for me to do back home. I moved out to try and expand."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He shrugs. "Dyrwood is a former Aedyre colony, so it seemed like a good place to start. And as much as I admire the Readcerans' work ethic, they've always struck me as a little... fanatical."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"It's not as big as it used to be, but it's still big. The mainland is a continent northwest of here, but the colonies used to include Readceras and the Dyrwood.

"About one hundred fifty years ago, Dyrwood won its independence from the empire, a fact our companions are quick to remind me of." He gives you a lopsided grin and nods at the other scattered caravanners.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I don't see it that way." Heodan begins re-stacking the crates in his wagon. "My brothers and I are all working together for the sake of the family enterprise."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He shakes his head and laughs when he notices you. "Brought a whole wagon full of goods to sell but not enough shirts for the road."

He scratches one cheek with his knuckles. It's covered with uneven stubble, as if he hasn't quite gotten used to shaving on the road.</DefaultText>
