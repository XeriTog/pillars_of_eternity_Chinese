      <DefaultText>"Well, finally, I was starting to think-" The woman makes a startled noise once she turns around and sees you. "Oh! I'm sorry, I was expecting someone else." She gives you a cautious smile. "Can I help you?" </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"My sister, Calisca, is traveling with one of the caravans. She sent a letter before she came. Said she was going to pay her way by working as a guard for the caravan master. She always was a tough one." She pauses. "I don't suppose you've seen her on the road? Or the caravan, perhaps? It's Master Odema's."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>13</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I hoped Calisca could help me. They say Ranga, the old midwife, knows a way to prevent a child being Hollowborn. But she moved south to Ansl&#246;g's Compass two seasons ago. The journey's too far for me. I can't make it as I am. But I don't have anyone else, now, with Calisca gone." More tears run down her face. "Please... can you help me?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Aufra blinks, eyes wide. "You will? Oh, gods bless you. Here, I'll give you coin to pay her with. You needn't trouble yourself with that. I think it's a drink she fashions out of... well, I'm not sure. But it shouldn't be too much of a burden to carry back."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"But that's..." Aufra's happiness quickly fades. "But everyone said..." She looks away. "I should have known. I've been so stupid. How could I think - I'm sorry. I wasted your time." </DefaultText>

      <ID>34</ID>
      <DefaultText>Aufra takes a deep breath. "You're right. I... I shouldn't turn to such methods. There may still be another way." She seems to deflate a little, her face weary. "I won't take the potion. But thank you, all the same, for acquiring it for me." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Aufra looks close to tears once more. She nods, slowly. "Of course. Thank you for taking the time to go out there." </DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>37</ID>
      <DefaultText>Aufra is quiet for a long time, gazing down at her belly and the vial both. She reaches up to wipe away a tear. "It's my own fault for believing it. Thank you for telling me the truth." </DefaultText>

      <ID>40</ID>
      <DefaultText>Aufra gapes at you in clear shock. "You what? What possible reason would you have for doing such a thing?" She backs away from you. "You fiend! You black-hearted devil! You've taken the only hope I had. Get out of my house before I call the guards!" </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>A Dyrwoodan woman is standing in front of the fireplace, humming a quiet tune to herself - or perhaps to her unborn child, for she is clearly quite pregnant. She turns her head slightly as you enter.</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>51</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I knew... I told her it was a dangerous path to take. Calisca was always so certain she could take on any danger." Aufra sniffs. "Oh, my poor sister. I'm sorry, stranger, I just... I can't believe she's gone." </DefaultText>

      <ID>52</ID>
      <DefaultText>Aufra stares at you, eyes wide with stunned horror. "You... you can't mean...?" She takes a step back. "You monster! Did you come to gloat?" She takes in a deep breath, glancing at the door. "Help! Someone, please, help!" </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Well, no more than most here, I'd say. He doesn't usually come this way, but they say he's a reliable old fellow." She pauses, brows furrowing. "Wait... why do you say 'knew'?" </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Ansl&#246;g's Compass is what we call the lagoon to the south. You'll have to cross the wilds to get there. That's what keeps me from trying it myself." She clasps her hands together. "Thank you again, truly. You'll be saving us both." She sets a hand on her stomach, smiling through her tears. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Aufra wipes at her eyes. "I-I'm worried about the baby. About the Legacy. I told Calisca as much as I could, but all I know is that for a long time now, every child born in Gilded Vale has been... soulless. Empty." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"It's happened to so many mothers. And Lord Raedric, he's exiled all of them, calling it a sign of the gods' disfavor." She sniffs. "With my H&#228;thort gone, I don't know how I'd manage if I lost my home, too." </DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>63</ID>
      <DefaultText>Aufra looks at you with some surprise, before dabbing at her nose with a sleeve. "That's kind of you to offer. But I don't know if I could impose this on you. It's not a small favor." </DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>64</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I..." Aufra nods, though her expression falls. "That's all I can ask. Thank you." She takes a shaky breath. "I'm sorry, I just - I need a moment." She turns away, covering her face with her hands.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Oh - it's south of here, past the wilds." Aufra eyes you hopefully. "If you should happen that way, please... perhaps you'd consider speaking to Ranga for me." </DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>68</ID>
      <DefaultText>Aufra gives a solemn nod. "Yes. It was my husband and I for a good many years. My H&#228;thort. Taken by bandits out on the southern road. Gods keep him." She sighs, looking back at the fireplace. "I miss him every day." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Let me think... We're farmers, mostly, but there has always been work and opportunity for people coming in from elsewhere. In the old days, at least. The Black Hammer Smithery's been here for a long time. That's Tuatanu's place, south of the mill." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"And then there's the Black Hound, just a ways south of here..." She sighs, trailing off. "I have to admit, I don't go out much, anymore. With that... horrible tree out there. Things aren't like they used to be. But I don't have anywhere else to go." </DefaultText>
