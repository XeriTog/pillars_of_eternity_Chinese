      <DefaultText>A man approaches you, his skin as dull and gray as the desolate village behind him.

He scans you with sunken, lifeless eyes. "You must be one of the new settlers." His voice is a dry croak. "Welcome to Gilded Vale.

"You'll be pleased to know that we've had some recent vacancies here." He glances at the gnarled, leafless monstrosity of a tree next to him.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Urgeat wears a twisted frown. "I'm afraid I still can't help you find residence here. Lord Raedric's son was deemed a Hollowborn. This makes circumstances even more fraught than before."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Magistrate Urgeat looks down his nose at you. "This means, of course, that you went into the temple yourself." He scratches his chin with a long, thin finger. "Not ideal, but it's better to know this now, before the temple is rededicated to Berath."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"There is no excuse for Wirtan, however. His deceit cost lives and could have jeopardized Lord Raedric's careful efforts. He will be dealt with." He turns toward the tree.

      <DefaultText>"I should warn you, stranger. Here in Gilded Vale, we have a special place for dissidents, charlatans, and those who would hide a curse in our midst." He steps to the side and inclines his head ever so slightly toward the deformed tree.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>His gaze swivels back to you. "Of course, we'll need to make some inquiries first. The inestimable Lord Raedric VII has taken great pains to insulate our town from Waidwen's Legacy."

He appraises you over half-moon spectacles and scratches his chin. "Have you ever sired a Hollowborn child?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"His lordship's wife is with child and due any day now. Without his approval, I shan't be able to find you a permanent settlement. It will have to wait until after the birth." He folds his arms. "We can continue our interview then, after the bell tolls from Raedric's Hold to signal my lord's new heir."

"In the meantime, you can find temporary accommodations at the inn just southwest of here."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"He comes from a line of nobles who have defended these lands since Aedyre times. Raedric II was an early supporter of Dyrwoodan independence during the revolution, and the current lord's father perished in the Saint's War.

"Hollowborn began appearing in the Dyrwood shortly after the war's end."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Our age's most egregious example of man's madness. Fifteen years ago, the people of Readceras decided that Waidwen, their living saint, was the literal incarnation of the god Eothas." Urgeat wrinkles his pinched nose.

"This supposed saint took it upon himself to liberate the Dyrwood. Supposedly from allegiances to less worthy gods, but I've never known an army to conquer a land for its people's own good."</DefaultText>

      <ID>42</ID>
      <DefaultText>"The war lasted about a year, but you can guess what that year did to the worship of Eothas in the Dyrwood. Lord Raedric's forebears had all been Eothasians, but after his father fell defending us from those fanatics, he personally saw that the Temple of Eothas here in town was shut down." He points at a few ruined walls near the tree.</DefaultText>

      <ID>43</ID>
      <DefaultText>He shakes his head. "Pitiful, dumb things that breathe - barely - but do not truly live. Some say the Hollowborn are a disease. Some say they are a punishment from the gods."

He raises his empty hands. "In truth, no one knows. But they began spreading after the Saint's War, and so the name 'Waidwen's Legacy' stuck in honor of that foul, blasphemous pretender." His voice shakes with vitriol.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"We're a frontier village, as are most settlements in the Dyrwood. Gilded Vale hasn't grown much since its establishment in the colonial days, and the last fifteen years have seen our population shrink further." He takes in the ramshackle houses and half-fallen fences. 

"Hence our recruitment of fresh settlers."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Waidwen's Legacy, of course. Many women have had difficulty bearing healthy children of late. A few years ago, Lord Raedric decreed that no mothers of Hollowborn are to be allowed in Gilded Vale." His mouth tightens into a firm line. "His lordship dealt swiftly with the objectors.

"It may be harsh, but if it purges us of this curse, is it not worth it?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Lord Raedric has taken it upon himself to purge the curse from Gilded Vale. His measures have been severe but necessary.

      <DefaultText>Urgeat doesn't even look over his shoulder. "Ah, yes. Not everyone has accepted the measures necessary to keep the village safe. Ever since Lord Raedric banished the mothers of Hollowborn, some have taken up arms against him.

"And while he's been searching for a cure, he's been beset with frauds and opportunists."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"We've had ciphers, wizards, and animancers come through town, taking the lord's coin and promising to end the curse. Lord Raedric finally decided to make an example of those who would profit from our tragedy."

He points to the body of a dwarven woman. "The latest was an animancer from the Vailian Republics, who claimed to know techniques none of us had seen.

"By now, we've seen it all."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He regards you carefully. "You'll want to mind where you mention that. Trespassing on Engwithan ruins is illegal, not to mention dangerous.

      <DefaultText>"That's what's left of the Temple of Eothas." His lips pucker. "Lord Raedric forbade worship of the dead god after the Saint's War. It's been abandoned for almost fifteen years, but there are plans to rededicate it to Berath, the god of life and death."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The magistrate frowns. "Whatever your... problem, it sounds like a matter for an animancer. However, the only animancer in Gilded Vale isn't in any condition to speak." He points at a body hanging from the tree. 

He sneers. "Consider yourself fortunate. After she failed Lord Raedric, we saw to it that she wouldn't profit from the misplaced trust of others. A bad cure is often worse than none at all."</DefaultText>
