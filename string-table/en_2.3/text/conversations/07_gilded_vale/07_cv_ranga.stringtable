      <DefaultText>You find yourself facing a towering aumaua woman. Her skin is the warm gold-brown of a dying sunset, with pale, fish-white patches at throat and hands. Wavy red-brown hair, pulled into tight braids around a stripe of bare skin that follows the curve of her skull, flows down over her broad shoulders. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Careful with those sporelings. They have a way with the mind." Ranga taps her temple lightly. "It's why the spores are so useful, really." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"It is good to see you are well. Was there anything else I can do for you?" She laughs. "Not all my remedies are quite so difficult to obtain, I assure you." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Aufra sent me here. She says that you know some way to ensure that her child is not a Hollowborn."</DefaultText>

      <ID>9</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Ah. More of Lord Raedric's frightened flock." She nods slowly. "I know what she's speaking of. I imagine she's somewhat desperate, sending you out here for her. She gave you payment, I expect?" </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>10</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I had to kill the xaurips on the way here. They won't bother you anymore." </DefaultText>

      <ID>11</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Alright. I'll be back when it's done." </DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>13</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Truly? You are very efficient with your favors. Here - something for your trouble." She nods, and claps her hands, once. "Good. Then I shall set my full attention now upon the remedy for Aufra."</DefaultText>

      <ID>14</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I will get started on the mixture... but I need one more ingredient. Some spores from the creatures in that cave, there." She points just north of her little stretch of beach. "Sporelings, they call them. It is a useful material. I need one, for the mixture. You are welcome to any others you find." </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>15</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Good, good. You'll find them easily enough, I think." She smiles, baring sharp teeth. "Good luck." </DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>16</ID>
      <DefaultText>Ranga laughs quietly. "Funny thing about moving out here - copper coins don't seem half as useful as they used to. Now, favors, that I can appreciate. Do this for me and you can keep your coin. You will find I'm much more willing to trade than the xaurips are."</DefaultText>

      <ID>19</ID>
      <DefaultText>"My name is Ranga. I lived in Gilded Vale a time, working as a healer and a midwife. Perhaps you've been to that place? You'll understand, then, why I might choose to come south." </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>20</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Yes." Ranga points a finger inland. "The xaurip camp to the northeast, there... I want you to clear it out. Then perhaps Tana here can sleep in peace."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>21</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I need some spores from the creatures in there. Foul little things. You'll know them when you see them." She smiles toothily. "Just don't breathe in too deep, hm?"</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>25</ID>
      <DefaultText>Ranga smiles. "This is what I need to make the potion Aufra asks for. If you do not wish to help, then... I cannot do anything about that, can I?"</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>26</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Good. I will prepare the rest while you are gone. Once you return, it should not take very long to finish." </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>27</ID>
      <DefaultText>"So you do. Excellent. Give one here, and I'll add it to the cauldron." </DefaultText>

      <ID>31</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Good. I tired of their feeble attempts to surprise us. Here." She hands you three phials."For your trouble. And now we can get underway with my part of the bargain."</DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>36</ID>
      <DefaultText>"The mixture is ready. Take this to Aufra. Tell her to drink it before bed, as it induces sleep. She should find herself more energetic in the mornings." </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>37</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Tell her to eat more fish. And cheese. The potion will sustain a healthy appetite. Grant her strength. She's a rather frail woman, from what I remember of her." </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>38</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I have done what I can, as promised. Tell Aufra I wish her well." </DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>44</ID>
      <DefaultText>She regards you calmly, evidently unsurprised to find you here at the edge of her camp by the water. "Have you come for medicines and craftworks, or to share the fire?" She gestures to the large cauldron nearby. </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>45</ID>
      <DefaultText>"What's that xaurip doing here?" </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>46</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Who, Tana? He helps me gather ingredients, work the cauldron, things like that. He's been quite a help around here." </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>47</ID>
      <DefaultText>The xaurip lets out a rattling chirrup and bares its teeth in what you guess is intended to be a cheerful expression.</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>48</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Whatever it is, you keep it. I don't need coin. I need you to do something for me, instead." Ranga points inland. "There is a xaurip tribe, to the northeast, led by one of their priests. Tana was exiled from there some time ago, and their scouts still lurk about this place, waiting for an opportunity to end his life." </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />

    <Entry>
      <ID>49</ID>
      <DefaultText>"One day I will have to go for supplies, and I will come back to find my assistant slain. How will I help anyone then?" She shakes her head. "You rid me of this nuisance, and I will do what I can for Aufra. And throw in something for you, too." </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>51</ID>
      <DefaultText>"In any case it is far more comfortable here, by the shore, where I can hear the water. And I still get visitors from time to time. Perhaps you're in need of something?" </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>52</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Wait - I thought this was a cure." </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>53</ID>
      <DefaultText>"What's in this 'potion', anyway?" </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>54</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I can tend to ailments of the body. I cannot cure an affliction of the soul. Certainly not one inflicted by the gods." Ranga crosses her arms. "I have explained many times. People will believe what they want." </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>55</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I cannot reveal all my secrets." Ranga smiles. "Some dank spores, you know that much. They will bolster the strength in her soul. Give her what energy they once stole." </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>56</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Ranga, you're nothing but a charlatan!" </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>57</ID>
      <DefaultText>"So let her believe. Perhaps that will help. Faith is a powerful thing. In the meantime, she will feel much improved, and if her child should not be claimed by the Legacy, then it will be born healthy. That I will promise." </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>58</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Nonsense. I am many years now a midwife. What I am not is a worker of impossible miracles. If you want to do something about the Legacy, I tell you this: better to deal with Lord Raedric. It is his punishment which drives these women to me." </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>59</ID>
      <DefaultText>"It will not cure the Legacy. I will tell you that plain. I can tend to ailments of the body. But not afflictions of the soul. Certainly not ones inflicted by the gods." Ranga crosses her arms. "I have explained this, but... people will believe as they like." </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>60</ID>
      <DefaultText>[Leave] "Fine. I'll be going, then." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I'll take it to her." </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>62</ID>
      <DefaultText>Ranga eyes you a moment. "You know, of course, that this will not cure the Legacy? I can tend to ailments of the body. But not afflictions of the soul. Certainly not ones inflicted by the gods." Ranga crosses her arms. "I have explained this, but... people will believe as they like." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Ranga, is it?" Kana chuckles. "And what are you ranga nui of, cousin? Why not sail north and join us in Rauatai?" </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>65</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Is that where you found that accent, islander?" Ranga smirks. "Keep your Rauatai. I would sooner be king of this little island." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Turns out I don't need the mixture anymore." </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>68</ID>
      <DefaultText>Ranga gives you a suspicious look, then shrugs. "So be it. I will still give you a few potions, if you've cleared out those xaurips for me." </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>69</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Actually, I don't need that mixture anymore." </DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>70</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Good. I tired of their feeble attempts to surprise us. Here." She hands you three phials. "For your trouble. Is there anything else?" </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>71</ID>
      <DefaultText>Ranga eyes you suspiciously a moment, then shrugs a shoulder. "So be it. If you happen to collect some spores in your travels, you should know that they can be useful ingredients. Is there anything else?" </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>73</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Keep it. Turns out I don't need it." </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>74</ID>
      <DefaultText>"What?" Ranga narrows her eyes suspiciously. "You'd have me work at this for nothing?" She snorts. "So be it. I will save it for someone who can make use of it." </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>75</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Apologies, Ranga. The circumstances changed." Kana grimaces, and looks down at the sand. "Unfortunately." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Ah. More of Lord Raedric's frightened flock." She nods slowly, her gaze running over you. "It's a cruel thing she sends my way... Poor Aufra must be desperate indeed. She gave you a great deal of coin, I imagine?" </DefaultText>
