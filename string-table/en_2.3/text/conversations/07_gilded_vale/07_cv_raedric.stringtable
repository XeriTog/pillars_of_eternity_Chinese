      <DefaultText>"Let him approach." Flanked by a host of guards, all of whom regard you with mute hostility, Lord Raedric VII observes you from his throne, clad in ornate plate. His eyes have a hollow quality, and there is a pallor to the man's gaunt face that leaves his features showing stark against his dark and unkempt hair. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Stop me? From saving Gilded Vale? From doing what I must to see this curse lifted, and our children restored? What purpose is there in that?" Raedric sneers. "No, you come to put a weaker man upon the throne for no reason but that he clamors for it, and claim it just." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Dead. So swiftly?" A peculiar smile forms on Raedric's face, his teeth bared in fierce triumph, or else in pain. "Then you have succeeded where a great many have failed. Would that my captains were half so efficient.

"Gilded Vale owes you a debt, for you have removed the greatest obstacle to its restoration." He makes a quiet, amused noise. "And rid me of a persistent hornet in the process." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Wretched serpent." Raedric fixes a contemptuous look upon you, and rises from his throne. "Once I cleave your miserable head from your body, perhaps your soul will find more suitable moorings within some whimpering mongrel." He draws his blade. "Guards - kill him." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"You've come far closer than his people ever did." Raedric looks to his guards, who shuffle nervously. "Much too close." He looks back to you. "A quiet infiltration, and done more skillfully than Kolsc could ever manage. I did not expect it." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"What has my cousin promised you? Some grand reward? If he had any resources to his name, he would not covet mine." Raedric's expression hardens. "And if he had any honor in him he would not have tried this here, now, when I have lost so much." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Oh, yes... We are kin, he and I. He was raised within these walls, in fact. Privy to all the privileges our family had to offer. But a greedy man always hungers after more than he receives, however bountiful. I was eldest - heir to the stewardship of our lands. And he was not." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"The Legacy brought chaos with it. Panic and despair. Kolsc took advantage of that chaos, creating division in our ranks. Luring loyal men and women to his cause. Good men. Good women." 

Raedric's gaze goes distant, for a moment. And then he glances at you, and his lip curls. "He fled the keep, in time, to hole up in the wilds beyond the village. To play at being a commoner, and court favor with the people." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"And while he plays at conqueror, the Vale suffers. Families, traders, all. I do not have enough men to guard the roads and defend us from Kolsc's incursions both. My attention suffers, and so my governance... my family..." 

Raedric breathes out through his nose. "Nor can I make the effort necessary to bring about an end to this curse if we are beset at all hours by his traitorous plots."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Raedrics? It is but I, alone, now. But the Raedric name was birthed in glory. We have been stewards of Gilded Vale for generations. Its people look to us still for guidance and protection. First from the excesses of the Empire - and now from what dangers the Dyrwood holds." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"The Legacy," Raedric breathes. "Shortly after the death of the Scattered God, Waidwen's Legacy fell upon our lands." 

He shakes his head. "And despair came with it. How could it not, when the curse took our children - our hope - from us?" </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Raedric looks to the dagger resting on the throne. "I will do what I must to ensure that we do not stray again from the path. But it has taken time to root out the last of these cultists within our village. Time Kolsc used to gather his forces." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Raedric's frown deepens, but he only nods. "So be it." Raedric rises from the throne, and around him his guards settle into battle stances. "May the Twinned God take pity upon your splintered soul, and scatter it to the winds." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Good." Raedric sinks back in his seat. Success seems to have leeched some strength from him, for there is a haggard weariness upon his face, now. "You will not have to look far. His camp lies in the wilds past Gilded Vale. His scouts watch the roads, and warn him in advance of my forces - but you should have more luck. Deal with him, and then return here." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"It is unlike Kolsc to hire mercenaries." Raedric's voice is a low rasp, his gaze fixed upon you. "Or foreigners, for that matter. And you are not one of mine." He smiles grimly, flashing white teeth. "So I cannot accuse you of treason." His fingers close loosely around the pommel of the dagger, as if to ascertain if it is still there, and then flinch away. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Raedric makes a low, huffing noise of disbelief. "And you think Kolsc is that leader? What does he understand of what it means to be thayn?

"... My own wife - she continued her heresies, against my wishes. And when our child was born, we saw then that no sin remains unrevealed." His jaw works. "No man is free from Berath's judgment. No woman." </DefaultText>
