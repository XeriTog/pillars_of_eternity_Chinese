      <DefaultText>"A terrible noise. I thought maybe it was a survivor - but he wasn't alive. Moving, but not truly alive." She shudders. "It was awful." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Fishing, of course. Except I lost my fishing rod when I flung it at the head of one of those monsters." He sighs.

      <DefaultText>"Well, fishing, of course. ...We were, anyway. Not much to be had up here in these little tide pools. We'll wait a while, see if those folks leave anytime soon." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Oh, it's the rock down to the southeast. The formation, I mean. Someone figured it looked a little like a sundial, you know? I don't really see it..." </DefaultText>
