      <DefaultText>Lord Gaderman's robes are of a simple, modest cut. Unlike the nobles around him, he wears only one gold ring. He looks at you with a kind and welcoming expression. "So, you're the newcomer who's been so busy around Defiance Bay. It's a pleasure to meet you."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Lord Gaderman's robes are of a simple, modest cut. Unlike the nobles around him, he wears only one gold ring. He looks at you with a kind and open expression. "Welcome to Brackenbury. How may I be of service?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I'm a noble here in Brackenbury, but, please, don't judge me too harshly." He laughs. "My forebears were successful merchants in the days of Duc Hadret, and I have the honor of heading philanthropic projects in the current administration. I spend a lot of my time out here, trying to get my peers more involved in charity work, but many of them only set foot in Ondra's Gift to visit that brothel."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He pauses. When he speaks again, his voice sounds dry and cracked. "It's a sickness. Some evil polluting my soul. I've tried everything, but watching Lumdala's performances soothes me in ways those treatments at the sanitarium never can."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>His eyes are distant, transfixed. "There's something about watching a person's last moments, seeing the instant the soul departs for the next life. When I was young, I'd go hunting with my father and watch deer fall to his arrows, but now..."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>His face contorts in bitterness. "The gods, in their infinite wisdom, made me this way. I manage my condition the best I can, and meanwhile I help the less fortunate. Whatever I can do to pay this penalty on my soul."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I don't expect you to condone my actions, but don't turn me in. I have to believe that, one day, if I continue to work for the greater good, the gods will remove this burden from me. For as many people as I've hurt, I've helped a hundred more."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Yes, I know." Gaderman sighs and pulls a ring out of his pocket. "A signet ring from House Reymont, made specially for Linete. Provide this with your accusation, and people will believe it all too easily."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"The girl is unwell. It wouldn't surprise anyone, myself included, for her to do something like this." He looks at the ring in his hand. "I'm not proud of asking you to do this, but she'll never function in normal society. This may even get her out of her father's house and into the specialized care she needs."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I should leave town for a bit. Clear my head, let this whole thing blow over." He meets your eye. "Thank you for giving me this chance. One day, I swear, I'll be worthy of it."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Do what you feel you must. But I won't see my family's name dragged through the mud." Before you can react, Gaderman flips back the bezel of a large, engraved ring. He throws his head back and tosses the contents into his mouth.

No sooner does he swallow than he pitches forward, clawing at his throat as his mouth gapes in silent agony. Within seconds, he is dead.</DefaultText>
