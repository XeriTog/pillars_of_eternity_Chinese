      <DefaultText>A woman paces back and forth, her feet crunching on the soft red carpet. She gestures and mumbles to herself, shaking her head as she pores over pages of notes. 

She almost walks into you. "Eccosi! Here I am, looking so hard for answers in my research that I do not see the kith standing in front of me. What can I do?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"According to my research grant, I study Awakenings. Sublimating pre-Awakened souls has been one of animancy's greatest successes, and I am working on a method to replicate the process on Awakened souls." She gnaws at her lip.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She laughs bitterly. "Ac, that would be me. Though the lack of research subjects has made me more of an expert in counting floorboards.

"I would like to transfer animancy's success in buttressing pre-Awakened souls to soothing those whose souls have already Awakened. But I need subjects, and most of the patients here are too broken to produce reliable results. It is a tragedy, to have come so far for nothing."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I jest! You Aedyrans are so uptight. I do not even know what the thing is used for. It belonged to the last occupant of this office, I think. Now, they upgrade him to a cell.

"Again. I jest."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She rubs her hands together, getting down to business. "So. I need you to sit here..." She takes Aloth by the shoulders and steers him to the couch. "And try to relax. But don't try too hard. Then you will not be relaxing."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"And you must also wear these. A little cold, but the copper will help conduct your essence." The animancer fastens thick copper bands to Aloth's forehead and wrists. As she ratchets them tighter, his face twitches with suppressed irritation. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Now. I will examine your soul through my scope." She reaches into her desk and produces a long, chambered tube. Knobs, dials, and small, toothed wheels run along the side of the device. "It is fitted with adra lenses cut to different thicknesses and concavities. By manipulating them, I find the angles and densities that will allow me to track the anomalies in your soul." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"There's nothing to tell. I was just a normal child living in the Cythwood." He looks to you. His face is set in a frown, but the rigid edges of apprehension show through nevertheless.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He closes his eyes. "Mother is away most of the time. With the thayn's family. But I always know when she is coming home. Father's bottles accumulate like storm clouds on the horizon. His fits of temper become swifter and more violent. It still shames him, knowing that her haemneg to another man supports us better than his labors as a steward."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I am in my fifth year of training. Mother is home. I can let my guard down a little because when she is around, he is usually only angry with her. But he has heard that I have had trouble casting missiles. That my flame shields are unstable. He is furious that I have failed, and Mother's presence reminds him that he has failed, too."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She scratches her chin. "Most interesting, but not the kind of Awakening I can study, I'm afraid. I need someone whose Awakened soul can be triggered with predictable stimuli. Souls such as these tend to manifest as alternate personas in the host."

She gives you a broad, if strained, smile. "But I thank you for the offer."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"It is a dynamic and respected field. Even the Baelreach Incident did little to slow it." She shrugs. "People in the Republics are more accepting of risk. Less superstitious. Ready to try anything that shows promise."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"It is, but such is the way of the Dyrwood. The people here are fierce about their sovereignty, but they are not so independent from their Aedyran brothers and their Glanfathan neighbors as they would like to think. They rely too much on the mysterious workings of the gods and fear the very advances they need."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"This is true of any great technology. You cut a man open to remove sick flesh, and there is a chance you kill him.

      <DefaultText>As you speak to Aloth, you feel your voice like a bell in your chest. It tolls softly, luring him into the mists of his own memory. Bellasege doesn't seem to notice anything, but you feel as if your words are smoothing his essence, untangling its many threads.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"The first blow takes me by surprise. One moment I am sweeping the kitchen, the next I am sprawled on the ground, stupidly looking at flecks of my blood on the tile. His boots, glistening with fresh polish, thud across the floor. He kicks me in the stomach, and I curl up to shield my vitals. But it's pointless. Protecting one thing only leaves something else exposed."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Still huddled on the ground, I retreat as fast as I can. I retreat until the vision of the kitchen and my own trembling knees is nothing but a pinprick against a field of black."

      <DefaultText>Your flattened palm is inches from his cheek when his hand shoots up and grabs your wrist. Aloth's eyes snap open, but the expression you see in them isn't his.

      <DefaultText>Bellasege sucks a deep breath through her teeth. "That's it! I'm seeing a shift in his essence. Something spreading and congealing." She glances at you over her scope. "Keep talking. He seems to respond to you."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Good, yes, very good!" She rests from her scribbling only to make another adjustment to her scope. "I can now see two separate patterns of essence. Where he ebbs, the other flows. It's as if the Awakened soul fills the spaces that he leaves empty."

      <DefaultText>As you turn to leave, you catch a darting movement out of the corner of your eye. Bellasege is humming to herself, still occupied with her scope, but Aloth is holding her notes. He's just about to tuck them into his cloak when he catches you watching.

He holds a finger to his lips, his eyes wide and imploring. "Please. I don't want my personal information published like this. Especially not after her nonsense."</DefaultText>
