      <DefaultText>The young elf is dressed in gaudy robes that he seems ready to cast off. He picks at a heavily brocaded sleeve and continually adjusts the gold chain around his neck. He looks up at you. "Did she send you to run me out of town? You can tell her I'm not going anywhere without that medallion."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Serel's a courtesan over at the Salty Mast in Ondra's Gift. We've been working together for over a year now. I find a noble with more money than sense, fill him up with liquor, and send him her way. They have a good time, and Serel takes her fee... and a little extra."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I grew up in Eir Glanfath with the Shattering Spear Clan. We Glanfathans have protected Engwithan ruins for thousands of years. It's the one duty the gods ask of us in exchange for the freedom to live as we please." He fidgets with an emerald ring on his pinky. "But treasure hunters looted the ruins in our territory, and we left the wilds we'd dwelled in for generations."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Most of my clan mates scattered to towns around the Dyrwood and probably live on crusts of bread." He looks at his embroidered robes with disgust. "Restoring this medallion to the ruins would earn us the gods' forgiveness. The Shattering Spear could go home."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"She's a good friend." He folds his arms in his trailing, wrinkled sleeves. "Without her, I'd probably be living hand to mouth like the rest of the Shattering Spear.

      <DefaultText>He clenches his heavily adorned hands. "It was this or scrape by in the gutters like the rest of my clan. But I'd give it all for that medallion. I offered to, but it's worth more than anything I've got, and Serel knows it."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He scowls at you for just an instant. As he squeezes his hands into fists, he seems to notice his gleaming, jeweled rings for the first time. "In a way, I guess I already have." He turns to the door. "Time to see what it holds for me, I suppose."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He tugs at the bracelet so hard it snaps. "The elders would say that this is the curse that comes from defiling the ruins." He takes the medallion's leather thong between thumb and forefinger and holds it away from his body. "Is something like this even worth it?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He sighs, arching his neatly plucked eyebrows. "Of course I could, but that's not the point. A community isn't a place, it's a connection to history and meaning." He makes circles with his wrist. "Like an anchor. Defending the ruins for the gods gave us a purpose. Without that, we're adrift. Does this make any sense to you?"</DefaultText>
